<h2>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<p>As the Pacific Series, just completed, is devoted
to stories of life and adventure on the
Pacific coast, the Atlantic Series, of which the
Young Circus Rider is the initial volume, will
comprise stories located nearer home. The author
will feel at liberty, however, should the exigencies
of the plot require it, to change the scene
temporarily to other parts of the continent.</p>

<p>The fascinations which the circus has always
exercised over the minds of young people is so
well known, that the author has felt justified in
selecting the hero of the present story from that
class of public performers who appeal so powerfully
to the imagination of his young readers.
In order to prepare himself for his task, he has
made personal acquaintance with more than one
hero of the ring, and has sought to furnish an inside
view of the life which he describes. He
hopes that the result may prove acceptable to the
juvenile public in whose behalf he is always
glad to labor.</p>

<span class="small">ANAK, THE NORWEGIAN GIANT.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="caps">A<span class="upper">bout</span> three o'clock in the afternoon an oddly
assorted couple walked through the main
street in the manufacturing town of Crampton.
One was a man of herculean proportions, fully
seven and a half feet high, but with a good-natured
face that relieved the fears which he might
otherwise have inspired. The other was a boy
of fifteen, tall and slender, with a dark complexion
and bright eyes. He found some difficulty
in keeping pace with his tall companion.</p>

<p>"You're going too fast for me, Anak," he said
at last. "Remember, my legs are not quite so
long as yours."</p>

<p>The giant laughed&mdash;a deep, resonant and not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
unmusical laugh, and answered: "I'm always
forgetting that, Robert. I suppose I ought to
walk alone, for I can't find any one to match me."</p>

<p>"See how people are looking at us," continued
the boy, glancing quickly back. "There's an
army of small boys following us."</p>

<p>"Do you want to see me scatter them?" asked
Anak.</p>

<p>"Yes; it will be fun."</p>

<p>The burly giant turned, and assuming a terrific
frown, ran back, his long limbs carrying him on
at remarkable speed. Instantly the boys, with
loud shouts of dismay, broke ranks and scattered
in every direction, not daring even to look over
their shoulders.</p>

<p>Anak came back, laughing heartily.</p>

<p>"I wonder what the boys thought I would do
to them," he said. "The fact is, I like young
people, and am always ready to take their parts;
but then, they don't know that. Did I look very
alarming just now?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Robert; "if I hadn't known
you, I might have run too."</p>

<p>"I don't know about that, Robert. No one
can accuse you of want of courage."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span></p>

<p>Robert smiled, and his dark face looked very attractive
when he smiled.</p>

<p>"I am not afraid of horses," he said.</p>

<p>"No; you are the most daring bareback rider
I ever knew."</p>

<p>"I don't think I ever was afraid of horses,"
continued the boy, thoughtfully. "I can't remember
the time when I was not used to them."</p>

<p>"How long have you been a bareback rider?"
asked Anak.</p>

<p>"I think I commenced when I was nine years
old."</p>

<p>"And now you are&mdash;how old?"</p>

<p>"Fifteen."</p>

<p>"You never told me how you came to join a
circus, Robert."</p>

<p>"I was wandering about the country&mdash;tramping&mdash;without
a friend, and without any means of
living, when a circus man offered to train me as
a rider. Anything was better than tramping,
and I accepted&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And now you are</p>

<p class="center bold in0 p2t p2b">ROBERT RUDD,<br />
THE BOY WONDER!<br />
<i>The Best Bareback Rider in the World.</i>"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span></p>

<p>"That's what the circus bills say," replied
Robert, smiling. "Now let me introduce you.
Gentlemen and ladies," said the boy, waving his
hand, as if addressing an audience, "I have the
pleasure of introducing to you,</p>


<blockquote>
<p class="center bold in0"><span class="large">ANAK!</span><br />
THE CELEBRATED NORWEGIAN GIANT!</p>

<p><i>Eight feet in height, and weighing four hundred and twenty
pounds, who has been exhibited before all the crowned
heads of Europe, and is generally acknowledged to be the
tallest giant in the world!</i>"</p>
</blockquote>


<p>"Good for you, Robert!" said the giant, good
naturedly. "You've got it by heart, my boy."</p>

<p>"I want to ask you a favor, Anak," said
Robert, slyly: "Speak a little Norwegian; I
want to know how it sounds."</p>

<p>"Oh go away with you! I don't know any
more Norwegian than you do."</p>

<p>"How is that? You don't mean to say you've
forgotten your native language?"</p>

<p>"I never knew a bit of Norwegian, Rob, my
boy; and as for native language, I'm minded to
tell you a secret."</p>

<p>"Go ahead!"</p>

<p>"I was born in Tipperary, and they didn't use
to speak Norwegian there when I was a boy."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span></p>

<p>"Then why do they call you a Norwegian?"</p>

<p>"It sounds better than Irish, you see."</p>

<p>"But haven't you ever been caught? Didn't
you ever have a Norwegian come up and try to
talk to you in his own language?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Anak, laughing, "and mighty embarrassing
it was, too."</p>

<p>"What did you do?"</p>

<p>"Faith, I opened upon him in old Irish. You
ought to have seen the fellow stare. I shrugged
my shoulders, and said I, 'You speak bad Norwegian,'
and the crowd believed me. He slunk
away, and that's the way I got over that."</p>

<p>"What's your real name, Anak?"</p>

<p>Anak looked about him guardedly, and finding
that no one was within earshot, he answered,
"Tom O'Connor, but don't give me away, Robert!"</p>

<p>"I don't believe I could, Anak," said the boy,
laughing.</p>

<p>Anak joined in the laugh, and Robert continued,
"When did you get your growth? I
mean, how old were you?"</p>

<p>"I kept on growing till I was twenty-one.
When I was sixteen I was six feet high, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
everybody thought I was through, but I kept on
till I reached seven and a half feet, and then was
tall enough to show."</p>

<p>"How about that eight feet, Anak?"</p>

<p>"You must ask the manager. They always
make giants taller than they are. It's equal all
round, and nobody's hurt. And now, Robert,
I'm going to ask you a question."</p>

<p>"What is it, Anak?"</p>

<p>"Do you expect always to be in this business?"</p>

<p>"Bareback riding, you mean? No, I hope
not," said the boy, gravely.</p>

<p>"I hope not, too. It'll do for a time, and
there isn't anything else open to a big overgrown
fellow like me, but you are a smart boy, and there
are plenty of chances for you to get into something
else. You never told me about when you
were a little boy; can you remember as far
back?"</p>

<p>"Not much," answered the boy, soberly.
"Sometimes I seem to remember a fine house
and grounds, and it seems as if I were riding on
a beautiful lawn, on a pony, with a servant at my
side. But it is provoking that I can't remember
any more, and the whole seems dim, and melts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
away, and it may be all imagination, after
all."</p>

<p>"It may be all true, Robert. Was it in America,
do you think, now?"</p>

<p>"That is more than I can tell. It may be
all fancy."</p>

<p>"Have you any relations living?"</p>

<p>"Not that I know of," said the boy sadly; "I
wish I had. I feel very lonely sometimes, and
there doesn't seem much to live for."</p>

<p>"You've plenty of friends, Rob&mdash;all of us like
you."</p>

<p>"Yes, you all treat me well."</p>

<p>"You have always been a favorite in the circus,
my lad."</p>

<p>"Yes; I never had anything to complain of
except that my trainer was sometimes a little
rough. But it isn't as if I had somebody belonging
to me&mdash;a brother, or a cousin, at the least.
Have you any relations, Anak?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I've got any number of cousins, and my
old mother's living, too, bless her heart."</p>

<p>"In Norway?" asked Robert, slyly.</p>

<p>"Oh go away! they know no more about Norway
than you do. It is in Tipperary they all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
live. I've forty or fifty cousins at the least, and
I'll give you a half a dozen with pleasure, if it'll
do you any good."</p>

<p>"I don't think they would answer my purpose,
Anak," answered the boy, smiling.</p>

<p>"Well, as I was sayin', Robert, I wouldn't stay
with the circus always if I was you."</p>

<p>"What else is there for me to do?"</p>

<p>"Wait and see. You're young yet."</p>

<p>"My education is very poor, you know, Anak."</p>

<p>"Can't you read and write?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but not much more. I should like to go
to school for two years."</p>

<p>"Sure you look like a gentleman, and you'll be
one some day, I shouldn't wonder."</p>

<p>"Look there, Anak!" said the boy, suddenly;
"there's a man who appears to be in trouble."</p>

<p>As he spoke he pointed to the driver of a team,
which seemed to have settled in the mud, for it
was now spring-time, and the roads were in a bad
condition. The driver was shouting frantically
to the horse, who was making desperate efforts to
pull the wagon out of the mire, but without success.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="small">ANAK'S EXPLOITS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="caps">"W<span class="upper">hat's</span> the matter, my friend?" inquired
Anak, addressing the driver of the team.</p>

<p>The latter stared in amazement at the gigantic
querist, but his trouble overcame his surprise, and
he answered, "You can see for yourself. My
wagon's mired and my horse is too lazy to draw it
out."</p>

<p>"Indeed the poor beast is unable," said Anak.</p>

<p>"He can do it if he wants to," said the driver,
angrily. "I'll see if I can't persuade him," and
he flourished a whip in a menacing manner.</p>

<p>"Hold there!" said Anak. "We'll see if we
can't help him."</p>

<p>So saying he went round to the back of the
wagon, and, seizing it in his powerful hands, cried,
"Now start your horse!"</p>

<p>The driver did so, and, with Anak's powerful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
help, the horse had small difficulty in extricating
the wagon from the mire.</p>

<p>"There, that's better than beating your horse,"
said Anak, stepping once more to the side of the
road.</p>

<p>"You're powerful strong, sir," said the teamster,
respectfully, surveying the colossal proportions
of Anak.</p>

<p>"I ought to be, oughtn't I?" returned Anak.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, sir, but do you belong to the circus?"</p>

<p>"Yes, you'll find me there if you take the
trouble to visit it."</p>

<p>"Are you the Norwegian giant?"</p>

<p>"That's what they call me," answered Anak,
smiling.</p>

<p>"Well, at any rate, I'm obliged to you for helping
me."</p>

<p>"And so is the horse, I'm thinking."</p>

<p>"Yes; you are as strong as a horse yourself,"
said the teamster, admiringly.</p>

<p>"That is convenient sometimes, my friend."</p>

<p>The teamster drove on, and Anak and Robert
also continued their walk.</p>

<p>"The manager doesn't like to have me show<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
myself for nothing," said Anak, "but I can't stay
under canvas all day to oblige him. My health
requires me to walk out in the open air."</p>

<p>"Does it require you to walk so fast, Anak?"</p>

<p>"Excuse me, Robert; I'm always forgetting."</p>

<p>"The manager has less trouble in keeping
Madame Leonora in," said Robert.</p>

<p>"That's true; she's too fat to walk much. She
weighs more than I do, though she's two feet
shorter."</p>

<p>They had drawn out of the village, and got
into the comparatively open country among the
farms. They were talking of one subject and
another, when suddenly their attention was drawn
to a small boy who was running towards them in
terror and dismay.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" asked Robert, his sympathy
quickly aroused; "are you hurt?"</p>

<p>"No," answered the boy, slackening his speed,
"but Mr. Tarbox is going to whip Jimmy."</p>

<p>"And who is Jimmy?"</p>

<p>"Jimmy's my brother."</p>

<p>"And what have you been doing?"</p>

<p>"We were only cutting across his lot, when he
came out and chased us, swearin' awful. I got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
away, but he's got poor Jimmy, and he's going to
horsewhip him," and the poor boy burst into terrified
tears.</p>

<p>Robert afterwards learned that this Tarbox was
a rough, tyrannical old farmer, noted for his bad
temper, who appeared to cherish a special antipathy
to boys. There was a footpath around his
field, which considerably lessened the distance to
the main road for some of his neighbors, but in
the ugliness of his disposition he forbade it to be
used. Men he did not venture to attack, but woe
betide the boy who ventured to enter his enclosure.</p>

<p>"Where is this Tarbox and your brother?"
asked Anak.</p>

<p>The boy pointed to a house and lot a little farther
on.</p>

<p>"We wouldn't have gone across-lots," he explained,
"but mother was taken sick, and we got
frightened and wanted to call the doctor as soon
as we could, and we thought we might do it for
once."</p>

<p>"Did you tell this man Tarbox the reason you
went across his field?" asked Anak.</p>

<p>"Yes, but he said it was no excuse, and I am
afraid he'll kill poor Jimmy."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span></p>

<p>The little boy fell to weeping again.</p>

<p>"There they are!" said Robert.</p>

<p>In a field, just off the road, was a strong,
brutal-looking man deliberately engaged in tying
a boy of twelve to a tree. The whip in his hand
showed what he intended to do afterwards. He
might indeed have dispensed with tying the boy,
for he was quite unable to escape, but he did it
on the same principle that a cat plays with a
mouse, to increase the terror of the poor victim.</p>

<p>His back was turned, so that he did not see the
approach of Anak and the two boys.</p>

<p>This was what the new-comer heard as they approached:</p>

<p>"Oh, please don't whip me, Mr. Tarbox,"
pleaded the poor boy, in an agony of apprehension.</p>

<p>"Then why did you come across my lot, you
little rascal?"</p>

<p>"I was in a hurry to call the doctor, because
mother was sick. Indeed that was the only
reason."</p>

<p>"I've got nothing to do with your sick mother,"
said Tarbox. "That was no reason for coming
across my field."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span></p>

<p>"I didn't hurt anything, sir; I just walked
along the path."</p>

<p>"I'll larn you not to try it again, Jim Benton;
I'm goin' to give you as good a floggin' as ever
you had. You can just tell the other boys how it
feels and mebbe they'll want to try it."</p>

<p>"Oh, please don't whip me! I ought to be
goin' for a doctor. My mother may die."</p>

<p>"She can die for all I care," said the brutal
Tarbox. "Now I've got you tied, and I'm goin'
to give your jacket a good warmin'."</p>

<p>He raised the whip and was about to bring it
down upon the shrinking limbs of the poor boy,
when he was startled by a deep, stern voice only
a rod behind him, "Don't touch that boy!"</p>

<p>Tarbox looked back and saw Anak striding
towards him. He had not seen him before, but
he knew who he was, for he had seen the posters
of the circus. Though rather startled, he was not
disposed to yield his victim easily.</p>

<p>"Get out of my field!" he snarled; "you're
trespassin'."</p>

<p>"I can't help it," said Anak; "I'm not going
to see a brute like you whip a poor child while I
am here to defend him."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span></p>

<p>"You ain't, hey?" snarled Tarbox. "I've got
the law on my side, and I'm goin' to do it. Just
you clear out, you two, or I'll have the law on
you."</p>

<p>He raised the whip, but did not get a chance to
use it. Anak reached him in one stride, snatched
the whip from his hand and flung it into the
road; then, grasping the stalwart farmer by the
collar, shook him till his teeth chattered, with as
much ease as Tarbox himself would have handled
the twelve-year-old boy.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you'll change your opinion now?" he
said.</p>

<p>Tarbox was astonished and cowed. There
wasn't a man in town that could cope with him,
yet he was but a child in the hands of the Norwegian
giant.</p>

<p>"I'll have the law of you!" he shrieked in furious
anger.</p>

<p>"So you may, but first you've got to untie that
boy."</p>

<p>"I won't!"</p>

<p>"You won't, hey?"</p>

<p>Again Anak seized him, and shook him vigorously
in spite of his struggles.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span></p>

<p>When he let him go, Tarbox, with an evil look,
called, "Here, Bruiser! come here, sir."</p>

<p>A large, wicked-looking bull-dog bounded over
a stone wall, and rushed forward evidently bent
on mischief.</p>

<p>"Sik him!" he exclaimed, pointing to Anak.</p>

<p>"Is your dog's life insured?" asked Anak,
calmly.</p>

<p>He waited till the dog was within a foot or two,
aiming to attack his leg; then he raised one of his
powerful feet, aimed a tremendous kick at Bruiser,
and the dog was stretched senseless at his feet.</p>

<p>"It's your own fault," said Anak, turning to
the farmer; "your dog is probably dead. Now,
untie that boy."</p>

<p>Tarbox by this time seemed thoroughly frightened.
With dark, sullen looks he obeyed the
giant, and Jimmy, overjoyed to recover his freedom,
stretched his arms and legs.</p>

<p>"Now, go for the doctor as fast as you please,"
said Anak.</p>

<p>The two brothers quickly started on their errand,
and Anak, turning to Tarbox, said, "You
miserable brute, if I ever hear of your attempting
to abuse a poor boy again, I'll travel five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
hundred miles if necessary to kick you as I have
kicked your dog. Go back to your house or I
may do it now."</p>

<p>Tarbox needed no second order. He was
rather afraid that he too might feel the weight of
the giant's boot, and he hurried away. Safe in
his own yard, he shouted, "I'll have you punished
for this, you big rascal!"</p>

<p>Anak only laughed.</p>

<p>"We may as well be going back, Robert," he
said; "I don't want to get into any more fights."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.<br />
<span class="small">THE WRATH OF MR. TARBOX.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="caps">C<span class="upper">olman's</span> Grand Combined Circus and Menagerie,
with its line of showy chariots, its collection
of animals from all parts of the habitable
world, and its general array of wonders, had
pitched its tent in a large otherwise unoccupied
lot in the eastern part of the town.</p>

<p>An immense tent, capable of containing six
thousand spectators, had been erected, and presented
a picturesque appearance. All was hurry
and bustle in and around the circus tent. Crowds
of staring urchins were gathered as near as possible,
on the chance of seeing something of the
wonders hidden by the canvas. I am afraid more
boys played truant on that day than had done so
for many previous weeks, for to the mind of the
average school-boy there is nothing more seductive
than a travelling show.</p>

<p>Anak and Robert had been missed, for it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
not often they absented themselves so long, and it
is possible that the heart of the manager might
have been stirred by apprehensions lest two of his
greatest attractions should have taken French leave
and forsaken him on the eve of battle.</p>

<p>When they were seen approaching, a boy
smaller than Robert ran to meet them.</p>

<p>This was Charlie Davis, also a bareback rider,
but a year younger than Robert, who performed
an act with him.</p>

<p>"Where have you been, you two?" he asked.
"I thought you'd run away?"</p>

<p>"If Anak ran away, it would take a fast runner
to catch him," said Robert. "No, we've
been taking a walk."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you tell me? I should like to
have gone, too."</p>

<p>"You're not much of a walker, you know,
Charlie. Still you might have helped us. We
got into a fight."</p>

<p>"Where? Who did you fight with?" asked
Charlie, his curiosity aroused.</p>

<p>"With a brutal old farmer, who had tied a boy
to a tree, and was going to flog him. You ought
to have seen how Anak tamed him down. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
just took him by the collar, and shook him as a cat
would a rat."</p>

<p>"What did he do?"</p>

<p>"He called his dog, a big, ugly brute, named
Bruiser. Bruiser's funeral will take place to-morrow."</p>

<p>"I wish I had been with you," said Charlie, in
a tone of disappointment.</p>

<p>"If you had, I should have let you do the fighting,"
said Anak. "Well, Charlie, how are things
getting on?"</p>

<p>"Oh, everything is about ready. They've laid
out the ring, and are putting up the seats. The
bearded lady's sick, and says she shan't appear if
she doesn't feel better. But they can spare her
better than they could us."</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Robert, smiling. "At
any rate, we have harder work to do than she,
though we may not get as much money."</p>

<p>"And it isn't as good fun, either," remarked
Charlie.</p>

<p>"That's true. Well, let us go in and see how
things are going on."</p>

<p>Charlie Davis was a year younger and considerably
smaller than Robert, but his line of business<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
was the same, and the two rode together well.
Young performers are always popular, and the
two boys always received their share of applause.
Charlie had a more lively temperament than Robert,
and being a little fellow was a general favorite
among the other performers.</p>

<p>Leaving the circus for a time we will go back
to Mr. Nathan Tarbox, who had been so signally
defeated in his plans of revenge upon his young
victim by Anak. As he entered the house he
was met by Mrs. Tarbox, who from the window
had witnessed with dismay the conflict between
her husband and the Norwegian giant.</p>

<p>She was a tall, bony woman, not usually demonstrative,
but she rushed up to her husband on this
occasion in a tremor of excitement and threw her
arms round his neck.</p>

<p>"Oh, Nathan!" she exclaimed, "I thought that
monster would kill you. I shook like a leaf when
I saw you in his grasp."</p>

<p>"Quit your fooling," returned the affectionate
husband. "Why didn't you come out and help
me?"</p>

<p>"How could I&mdash;a delicate woman like me?"
asked Mrs. Tarbox, reproachfully.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span></p>

<p>"I suppose you wouldn't have minded seeing
me killed before your eyes," retorted Nathan with
sarcasm; "you wasn't too delicate for that. I dare
say you'd like to be a widow."</p>

<p>"How can you talk so, Nathan? You hurt my
feelings. Do be reasonable, now. What could I
do?"</p>

<p>"What could you do? I'll tell you what you
could do. You could have taken the frying-pan
and laid it over his head. That's what you ought
to have done. Between us we could have managed
the big brute."</p>

<p>"You know, Nathan, I couldn't have reached
his head. Who is he? I never saw such a monster
before in all my born days."</p>

<p>"He's the Norwegian giant at the circus. If
he hadn't been a giant I could have managed
him. There isn't a man in town but I can handle."</p>

<p>"Of course there isn't. What made him touch
you?"</p>

<p>"It's all the fault of them bad Graham children
that tramped across my fields when I'd told 'em
not to. I was goin' to give the biggest one a
lesson with a horsewhip, when that overgrown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
ruffian broke in and seized me. I wish I had him
tied to a tree just for five minutes," said Tarbox,
walking the room in his fury. "Big as he is I'd
lash him till he bellowed for mercy."</p>

<p>"That would be nice, Nathan dear," said Mrs.
Tarbox, complacently.</p>

<p>"Nice, Mrs. Tarbox!" exclaimed her husband,
turning the vials of his anger upon her; "we
might have done it, too, if you had had the courage
to come out and stand by your husband.
You could have seized him from behind, while I
gave him a lashing. Instead of that you were
standing at the window smirking in your foolish
way, I've no doubt. A pretty wife you are!"</p>

<p>"O Nathan, I am sure you don't know what
you are saying. You forget I am a weak, delicate
woman."</p>

<p>Though Mrs. Tarbox was tall, strong, gaunt and
bony, she was accustomed to consider herself delicate.
It was fortunate that she was not so, and
that she was not particularly sensitive, or the
brutal temper of her husband would have worn
upon her more than it did. She was fortunate in
being a silly woman. It saved her much mental
suffering.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span></p>

<p>"You weak and delicate!" retorted her husband,
contemptuously. "So is a ostrich."</p>

<p>"Where's Bruiser? Why didn't you call him?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Tarbox had not witnessed the untimely
fate of that amiable quadruped.</p>

<p>At the mention of Bruiser her husband's wrath
again overflowed.</p>

<p>"He's dead!" he shouted. "That brute killed
him."</p>

<p>"How did he do it?" asked his wife, not without
curiosity, for she knew the bull-dog's strength.</p>

<p>"Kicked him to death! That's how he did it."</p>

<p>"He must be very strong," murmured Mrs.
Tarbox. "Don't you think we ought to erect a
gravestone over Bruiser," she continued, "just as
I did over that sweet canary? A piece of board
would do, you know."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you'd like to write some lines for it,"
remarked Mr. Tarbox, sarcastically.</p>

<p>"I was thinking, Nathan, we could put something
like this:</p>


<p class="center bold in0 p1t p1b">HERE LIES BRUISER!<br />
<span class="vspace">&#8195;</span><br />
Cut off in the flower of his youth&mdash;<br />
Gone to meet old Towser!"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span></p>

<p class="in0">and Mrs. Tarbox looked up to her husband for
his approval.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Tarbox," he said, "I believe you are the
greatest fool in town. Have you got any common
sense?"</p>

<p>"Nathan, you shouldn't talk so to your wife,"
she answered, placidly. "I only spoke for the
best; of course, if you think of anything you like
better, I don't care."</p>

<p>"I have no time to think of epitaphs on dogs,
Mrs. Tarbox. I've got something more important
to do. Do you know what I am going to do, Mrs.
Tarbox?"</p>

<p>"Change your shirt, perhaps," said his wife;
"you forgot to do it this morning."</p>

<p>Mr. Tarbox came near swearing.</p>

<p>"No," said he, "I'm going to have that brute
arrested for assault and battery, for trespassing
on my grounds and killing my dog. That's what
I'm going to do."</p>

<p>"So I would, Nathan. I wonder you didn't
think of it before."</p>

<p>"Then get supper ready, and I'll go round and
get a warrant for his arrest as quick as I get
through."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br />
<span class="small">MR. TARBOX INVOKES THE MAJESTY OF THE LAW.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="caps">E<span class="upper">zekiel Price</span>, justice of the peace, generally
known as Squire Price, was just rising from his
supper table when the one maid of all work, Bridget,
entered and said: "Mr. Price, old Tarbox is
at the door and wishes to see you."</p>

<p>"Old Tarbox!" repeated the squire in a tone
of reproof. "Really, you should speak more respectfully
of Mr. Nathan Tarbox."</p>

<p>"Everybody calls him old Tarbox," said Bridget,
"and he's the meanest man in town."</p>

<p>"Let that pass," said the justice, using a pet
phrase. "Tell him to come in."</p>

<p>Mr. Tarbox immediately afterwards was ushered
into the room.</p>

<p>"Good evening, Mr. Tarbox," said the squire,
in a dignified tone.</p>

<p>"Good evenin', squire."</p>

<p>"All well at home, I trust, Mr. Tarbox."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh yes," answered Tarbox, impatient to come
to business. "I've come on law business."</p>

<p>"Indeed!"</p>

<p>"I want justice!" continued the farmer, slapping
the table energetically, to the imminent hazard
of a cup and saucer standing beside.</p>

<p>"If I can be of any service to you in my&mdash;ahem!
judicial capacity, I of course should consider
it my duty to help you."</p>

<p>"I want a warrant for the arrest of a brute."</p>

<p>"Ahem! my powers do not extend to the arrest
of brutes. They are limited to human beings."</p>

<p>"You know what I mean&mdash;a brute on two legs,
and mighty long ones, too."</p>

<p>"I cannot say I apprehend your meaning, Mr.
Tarbox. Whom do you wish to arrest, let me
ask?"</p>

<p>"The Norwegian giant."</p>

<p>"The Norwegian giant!" repeated the squire
in astonishment.</p>

<p>"Yes; the giant they've got at the show."</p>

<p>"What has he been doing?"</p>

<p>"What hasn't he been doing?" shouted Tarbox.
"He came into my lot this afternoon, seized me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
by the collar, nearly shook me to pieces, and
kicked my dog Bruiser to death."</p>

<p>Squire Price listened in undisguised amazement.</p>

<p>"Really," he said, "this was a high-handed outrage.
Was he drunk?"</p>

<p>"No; he can't get off on no such plea as that.
He was as sober as you or I."</p>

<p>"Did he assign any reason for his extraordinary
attack?"</p>

<p>"He was meddling in affairs that he had nothing
to do with."</p>

<p>"What affairs?"</p>

<p>This was rather an embarrassing question to
answer.</p>

<p>"The fact is, I caught Jimmy Graham and his
brother cutting across my lot&mdash;a clear case of trespass&mdash;and
I was about to give Jimmy a lesson
when that brute interfered&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What sort of a lesson were you going to give
him?" asked the squire, shrewdly.</p>

<p>"Why, you see I had tied the boy to a tree,
and was going to touch him gently with a horsewhip,
when in jumped this overgrown bully and
attacked me."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span></p>

<p>"Ahem! I begin to see. I hear that the Graham
boys' mother was taken sick this afternoon,
and the boys were probably going for the doctor."</p>

<p>"So they said, but they had no right to go across
my lot."</p>

<p>"It strikes me, Mr. Tarbox, they were excusable
under the circumstances."</p>

<p>"No, they were not; I have forbidden 'em time
and again from goin' across my field."</p>

<p>"There's a path, isn't there?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but it's my path."</p>

<p>"Did the boy attract the giant's attention by
screaming?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Tarbox, to be frank with you, I
think it was very natural for him to interfere in
defence of a boy about to receive brutal treatment."</p>

<p>"I hope you ain't goin' to take the side of lawbreakin',
squire?"</p>

<p>"You say he seized you by the collar and shook
you up, Mr. Tarbox?"</p>

<p>"Yes; he made the teeth chatter in my head
till I thought they would drop out."</p>

<p>"And he frightened you, did he?"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes; I thought he was goin' to take my life,"
said Mr. Tarbox, desiring to make the assault
seem as aggravated as possible.</p>

<p>A mild smile played over the placid face of the
squire, who was evidently not impressed as he
should have been by the recital of Mr. Tarbox's
wrongs.</p>

<p>"And then you called Bruiser, did you, Mr.
Tarbox?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"What did you expect Bruiser to do?"</p>

<p>"I wanted him to tear the giant to pieces. He
was just makin' for his legs when the brute drew
back his foot and kicked him to death."</p>

<p>In his excitement Mr. Tarbox rose and paced
the room.</p>

<p>Squire Price smiled again. It is to be feared
he did not deplore, as he should have done, the
sad and untimely fate of the amiable bull-dog.</p>

<p>"Now, what do you want me to do, Mr. Tarbox?"</p>

<p>"I want a warrant for the arrest of this big
scoundrel."</p>

<p>"For killing Bruiser? That appears to have
been in self-defence."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span></p>

<p>"No; for assault and battery on me, Nathan
Tarbox, a free-born American citizen. It's come
to a pretty pass if I am to be attacked and nearly
killed by a foreign Norwegian, who has come
over to America to take the bread from our own
citizens."</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose I must give you what you
desire, Mr. Tarbox, if you insist upon it," said
the squire.</p>

<p>"Of course I insist upon it. I'm not goin'
to be trampled under foot by a minion of a foreign
power."</p>

<p>"Do you happen to know the giant's name?"
asked the squire.</p>

<p>Mr. Tarbox scratched his head.</p>

<p>"I can't say I rightly remember his name. I
think it's Enoch."</p>

<p>"Enoch! Very likely. That's a good Bible
name. Just wait here a moment, Mr. Tarbox,
and I will make out an order of arrest."</p>

<p>The squire left the room and returned in five
minutes with a paper duly drawn up, directing
any constable or police officer to apprehend the
giant known as Enoch, and produce before him to
answer to a charge of assault and battery on Nathan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
Tarbox, a citizen of Crampton. There was more
legal phraseology, but this was the purport of it.</p>

<p>"Thank you, squire," said Mr. Tarbox, in evident
gratification, as he deposited the valuable
document which was to secure his revenge in the
right inside pocket of his coat.</p>

<p>"Who are you going to get to serve the warrant?"
asked the squire.</p>

<p>"Sam Spriggins; he's the nearest constable."</p>

<p>"Very well," said the squire, with a peculiar
smile.</p>

<p>"I'm going to have him arrested just as the
evening performance is to commence," said Mr.
Tarbox, triumphantly; "that'll trouble him, and
probably they'll cut off his pay, but it'll serve him
right."</p>

<p>After Mr. Tarbox left the squire had a quiet
laugh, but as he did not mention to any one what
had aroused his mirth we are left to conjecture
what it was all about.</p>

<p>Nathan Tarbox proceeded at once to the house
of Constable Spriggins, and was lucky enough to
find him at home. In fact, Mr. Spriggins was
out in his back yard, splitting some kindlings for
use the next morning.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span></p>

<p>Sam Spriggins, who filled the high office of
constable, was not a man of imposing appearance,
he was about five feet eight inches in height, and
had hair of a flaming red, and probably weighed
about one hundred and forty pounds. It was
somehow suspected that Mr. Spriggins was not a
man of reckless bravery. He had never been
employed to arrest desperate criminals, and lawbreakers
were not accustomed to quail before his
glance. In fact, Sam was more likely to be the
one to quail. Why he had been appointed constable
was not very clear, but probably it came
about because no one else wanted the office.</p>

<p>"Good evening, Mr. Tarbox," said the constable,
desisting from his employment.</p>

<p>"Good evenin'. I've got some work for you
to do."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"I want you to make an arrest."</p>

<p>"Who's the party?" asked Sam, in a tone
which betrayed some apprehension.</p>

<p>"It's the Norwegian giant at the circus."</p>

<p>"Come now, Mr. Tarbox, you're joking," said
Spriggins.</p>

<p>"Joking!" shouted Tarbox. "Do I look like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
joking? Why, this Enoch came into my lot this
afternoon and nearly killed me. It's an outrageous
case of assault and battery, and here's
the warrant for his arrest duly made out by
Squire Price."</p>

<p>"Is he very large?" faltered the poor constable.</p>

<p>"Very large! He's eight or nine feet high,"
said Tarbox.</p>

<p>"Couldn't you call on some other constable?"
pleaded Spriggins, nervously. "You see, it's
very inconvenient for me to leave my work."</p>

<p>"No; you're the man, and it's your legal duty
to serve the warrant. Besides, the other constable's
out of town."</p>

<p>"When do you want the man arrested?" faltered
Spriggins.</p>

<p>"I want you to go right over to the show with
me now."</p>

<p>"Do&mdash;do you think he'll be violent?" asked
the constable.</p>

<p>"I can't say," answered Tarbox. "Anyhow,
the law is on your side, and I'll go with you, and
stand by you."</p>

<p>Sam Spriggins never in his life so deeply regretted
that he had accepted the office of constable.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER V.<br />
<span class="small">TARBOX AND THE CONSTABLE GO TO THE CIRCUS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="caps">"I <span class="upper">think</span> I'll go in and bid my wife good-by,"
said the constable, ruefully.</p>

<p>"What's the need of that?" asked Tarbox,
impatiently.</p>

<p>"We don't know what may happen," said
Spriggins, solemnly. "I'm ready to do my duty
by the gover'ment; but it's a risky business,
arrestin' a giant."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, be quick about it. I don't believe
Mrs. Spriggins will mind."</p>

<p>This remark did not seem to encourage or
soothe the constable, but he made no remark.
He went into the house, and Mrs. Spriggins followed
him when he came out.</p>

<p>"Nathan Tarbox," she said, "you're real mean
to get my husband into trouble."</p>

<p>"How have I got him into trouble," demanded
Tarbox doggedly.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span></p>

<p>"You want to get him into a fight with a
giant. He ain't fit to wrestle with any one, bein'
in poor health, least of all a giant."</p>

<p>"Ain't he a officer of the law? That's what I
want to know," said Tarbox.</p>

<p>"Why, yes."</p>

<p>"Then let him do his duty. I've put a warrant
into his hands, and Squire Price and I expect
him to execute it."</p>

<p>"Suppose he's killed?" suggested Mrs. Spriggins.</p>

<p>Her husband looked nervous at the possibility
hinted at, but Tarbox was inexorable.</p>

<p>"Then you can be proud of his dyin' while
doin' his duty. Come, constable, I've no time to
waste. Come along!"</p>

<p>"You're real mean!" ejaculated Mrs. Spriggins,
tearfully.</p>

<p>Tarbox deigned no answer, but strode out of
the yard, followed by the reluctant constable.</p>

<p>Few words were said, but when they were half
way to the circus grounds a bright idea struck
Spriggins.</p>

<p>"I say, Mr. Tarbox," he said, eagerly, "can't
we compromise this thing?"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't know what you mean."</p>

<p>"You might authorize me to say to the giant
in a friendly kind of way that your feelin's are
hurt, that it's probably all a misunderstandin', and
propose to make up."</p>

<p>"Spriggins, are you a fool? Do you think I'm
goin' to compromise after I've been shaken almost
to pieces and my dog has been kicked to
death?"</p>

<p>"He might agree to buy you a new dog, if it
was properly set before him."</p>

<p>"A new dog wouldn't make up for Bruiser.
He scared all the children in the neighborhood.
I shan't see his like again. What I want is&mdash;revenge!"</p>

<p>"Why don't you lay for him then yourself,
and not drag me into it?"</p>

<p>"Spriggins, I believe you're a coward&mdash;you're
afraid of this Enoch."</p>

<p>"Who wouldn't be afraid of a man eight or
nine feet high?"</p>

<p>"I ain't afraid of him," said Tarbox, stoutly.
"I'll stand by you; we'll face him together."</p>

<p>Seeing that there was no disposition to yield on
the part of his client, if I may so designate Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
Tarbox, the constable continued on his way,
grasping the warrant in uneasy fingers.</p>

<p>It was some distance to the circus grounds, but
the way seemed all too short for Constable Spriggins,
who felt like a man approaching an enemy's
battery.</p>

<p>At length they came in sight of the circus
grounds. Around the big tent were congregated
a crowd of men and boys, and a stream of people
was already marching up to the box office to buy
tickets, while hitched to trees and posts were
carriages and wagons of all descriptions which
had been employed to convey intending spectators
from the town round about. Nothing draws
like a circus in the country, or perhaps we may
add in the city also.</p>

<p>"There's goin' to be a crowd," remarked the
constable.</p>

<p>"Yes; fools and their money are soon parted.
I never went to a circus in all my life. It's all
foolery."</p>

<p>"I went once when I was a boy, and I liked it.
I little thought under what circumstances I
should make my second visit," said Spriggins,
ruefully.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span></p>

<p>"Circuses are wicked, in my opinion," said
Tarbox. "I'd close 'em all up if I could; we'll
do what we can to stop this."</p>

<p>By this time they had got into the crowd at the
entrance.</p>

<p>Instead of going up to the ticket office to
purchase tickets they passed on, and reached
the doorway where stood a man to receive
tickets.</p>

<p>"Where's your tickets?" demanded he of
Spriggins and his companion.</p>

<p>Mr. Spriggins turned to Tarbox expecting him
to explain.</p>

<p>"We don't need no tickets," said he in an impressive
manner. "This man is an officer of the
law."</p>

<p>"No deadheads&mdash;no free list," said the ticket-taker
shortly. "Stand aside!"</p>

<p>"You don't understand me," said Tarbox.
"This is Constable Spriggins, and he demands
admission in the name of the United States and
the Commonwealth of Massachusetts."</p>

<p>"The United States don't own this show, nor
yet the State of Massachusetts. Stand aside and
let those who have tickets enter."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span></p>

<p>"It's no use," said the constable, rather relieved.
"They won't let us in."</p>

<p>"This officer wants to make an arrest in your
building," said Tarbox, trying again.</p>

<p>"Can't help it! He can't get in without a
ticket."</p>

<p>"You see how 'tis," said Spriggins, cheerfully.
"We can't get in."</p>

<p>"Force your way in!" said Tarbox, indignantly.
"You've got the law on your side."</p>

<p>This the constable positively refused to do.</p>

<p>"Then buy a ticket and go in. The State will
pay you back."</p>

<p>"I've no call to do it, and I don't believe I'd
get my money back."</p>

<p>"You refuse to do your duty, do you?"</p>

<p>"No I don't. I've tried, and I can't. You
know how it is yourself."</p>

<p>Mr. Tarbox was nonplussed. He didn't like to
give up his cherished scheme of vengeance, yet
how was he to carry it out?</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what I'll do," he said; "I'll
buy you a ticket, and trust to the State to pay
me."</p>

<p>"You can't collect it of me," said the constable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
"even if the State don't pay you. You can
buy me a ticket if you want to."</p>

<p>But Tarbox was seized with a sudden suspicion.
Spriggins might go in and see the show at his expense,
and leave his duty unperformed. There
was nothing to do but to go in with him, and that
would involve the purchase of two tickets, and
the expenditure of an entire dollar, which Tarbox,
who was a close man, could not think of
without mentally groaning. Nevertheless, his
soul thirsted for revenge, and it was clear that revenge
could not be had without expense.</p>

<p>"Spriggins," he said, "I'll buy two tickets, and
we'll go in together."</p>

<p>The constable would have preferred to go in
alone. He wanted to see the show, and if he had
been unaccompanied he could have done so without
any troublesome duties disturbing his enjoyment.</p>

<p>"Jest as you say," he answered, a little nervously.</p>

<p>Mr. Tarbox joined the line, and gradually
worked his way to the ticket office.</p>

<p>"A couple of tickets," he said, handing a dollar
bill to the ticket agent.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span></p>

<p>Two tickets were immediately passed to him,
and he and the constable entered the tent.</p>

<p>Opposed as he was to the circus, Tarbox could
not forbear looking about him with considerable
curiosity. They were not yet in the main room,
but were in an outer lobby where were ranged
the cages of animals. Mr. Tarbox started as an
African lion, whose cage he was passing, roared,
and he regarded with some apprehension the gratings
of the cage.</p>

<p>"It's rather resky," he said. "Suppose the
lions or tigers should break out."</p>

<p>The constable trembled at the suggestion, but
still seemed interested in looking about him.</p>

<p>"Come, Mr. Tarbox," he said, "let's go and
look at the elephants."</p>

<p>"Do you think I came here to see elephants?"
he said, sternly. "Constable, I call upon you to
do your duty."</p>

<p>"How can I?" asked the constable; "I don't see
the giant."</p>

<p>One of the canvas men happened to be passing,
and Mr. Tarbox, rightly concluding that he was
connected with the show, asked, "Where's
Enoch?"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span></p>

<p>"Enoch!" repeated the canvas man, staring;
"I guess you're off. I don't know any Enoch."</p>

<p>"I mean the Norwegian giant."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said the attendant, smiling. "You just
follow round to the left, and you'll see him. He's
sittin' next to the fat lady."</p>

<p>"Constable," said Mr. Tarbox, grasping his
companion by the arm, "we are on the scent.
Come along, and we'll see what the villain has to
say to the law."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br />
<span class="small">TARBOX IS DEFEATED.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="caps">T<span class="upper">he</span> performance had not commenced&mdash;indeed,
half an hour would elapse before the hour
fixed&mdash;and several of the performers were to be
seen among the spectators about the cages of the
animals. One of these Tarbox recognized.</p>

<p>"Look at that boy!" he said, clutching the constable's
arm.</p>

<p>He pointed to Robert Rudd and Charlie Davis,
the two young riders, who were walking together.</p>

<p>"What of him?" asked Spriggins.</p>

<p>"That's the young villain that was with
Enoch."</p>

<p>Spriggins inwardly wished that the warrant was
for Robert instead of the giant.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you arrest him instead of the
giant?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I will yet, for he trespassed on my
grounds; but it was Enoch that shook me up and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
killed Bruiser. Look here, young feller," he said,
addressing Robert.</p>

<p>Robert turned and smiled as he recognized the
farmer.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's you," he answered.</p>

<p>"Yes, it's me," answered Tarbox sternly.
"Where is Enoch?"</p>

<p>"Who do you mean?"</p>

<p>"That overgrown brute that was with you this
afternoon."</p>

<p>Charlie Davis asked a question in a low voice
of Robert, and then turning to Tarbox before
Robert had a chance to answer him asked: "Do
you want to buy a dog, mister?"</p>

<p>"You're too small! I don't want a puppy!"
answered Tarbox, scowling.</p>

<p>"Oh, you're too fresh!" answered Charlie,
rather annoyed, particularly as Robert laughed.</p>

<p>"Why don't you answer me, boy?" demanded
Tarbox angrily.</p>

<p>"I will conduct you to my friend, the Norwegian
giant," answered Robert politely.</p>

<p>"Come along, Spriggins!" said Mr. Tarbox,
pulling after him the reluctant constable.</p>

<p>Spriggins would have enjoyed a leisurely examination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
of the Albino sisters, the wild man
from Borneo, the living skeleton, and the fat
lady, but none of them had attractions for Mr.
Tarbox, whose soul was fired by the desire for revenge.
All too soon they reached the chair where
in massive dignity sat Anak, the Norwegian giant.</p>

<p>As Anak's eyes rested on the approaching visitors,
he looked amused.</p>

<p>"I'm glad to see you, my friend," he called out,
in the deep tones natural to him, to Tarbox.</p>

<p>"And I'm glad to see you," said Tarbox, spitefully.
"I came here expressly to see you."</p>

<p>"You're very kind," said Anak. "Take a good
look. There ain't so much of me as there is of my
friend, Mme. Leonora," with a wave of the hand
towards the fat lady; "but you can look at me as
much as you want to."</p>

<p>"I shall soon see you in a prison cell," said Mr.
Tarbox, sternly. "Constable Spriggins, do your
duty, sir."</p>

<p>Poor Spriggins gazed at the immense man before
him, with his heart gradually sinking down
into his boots. Never in all his life had he been
placed in such an embarrassing position. What
utter nonsense it was for him to think of leading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
out such a monster by the collar. Why, he
couldn't begin to reach up to Anak's collar.</p>

<p>"Can't we compromise this thing?" he asked,
faintly.</p>

<p>"No, we can't, Spriggins; I insist upon your
doin' your duty."</p>

<p>"What do you want?" asked Anak, in some
curiosity.</p>

<p>"Produce your warrant, Spriggins," said Tarbox.</p>

<p>The constable mechanically drew it out from
his inside pocket.</p>

<p>Tarbox saw that he must take the initiative,
and he was perfectly willing to do so.</p>

<p>"Enoch," he said, "this man is an officer of the
law. He has a warrant for your arrest."</p>

<p>"For my arrest?" inquired Anak, opening his
eyes in amazed surprise.</p>

<p>"Yes, for assault and battery on me, Nathan
Tarbox, and the murder of my dog, Bruiser.
Such things can be done in Norway, p'r'aps, but
they ain't allowed in the State of Massachusetts.
Spriggins, do your duty."</p>

<p>The constable looked at the giant uncomfortably,
and edged away a little.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span></p>

<p>"What!" said Anak, shaking his sides, "does
he want to arrest me?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Tarbox, grimly. "Spriggins, read
the warrant."</p>

<p>"Read it yourself, Mr. Tarbox."</p>

<p>Tarbox did so with evident enjoyment, but
Anak's enjoyment seemed no less.</p>

<p>"Ho, ho, ho!" he shouted. "This is a joke!"</p>

<p>"You won't find it much of a joke," said Tarbox.
"Come, Spriggins, do your duty."</p>

<p>"Mr. Enoch," said the constable, in a trembling
voice, "if you'll come with me without making
any fuss, I'll see that you are well treated."</p>

<p>"Suppose I don't?" said Anak.</p>

<p>Spriggins looked helplessly at Tarbox. That
was a question he could not answer.</p>

<p>"Then it'll be the worse for you," said Tarbox,
who was always ready to make up for his companion's
deficiencies.</p>

<p>"Can't you wait till the performance is over?"
asked the giant, smiling.</p>

<p>"To be sure," said Spriggins, quickly. "Anything
to oblige."</p>

<p>"No," said Tarbox, decidedly. "The warrant
must be served now. You have no discretion."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span></p>

<p>"I'd like to oblige the gentleman," said the constable,
who wanted to avoid trouble and see the
performance.</p>

<p>"You can't. It won't be allowed."</p>

<p>"What's the use of losing the benefit of our
money, Mr. Tarbox?"</p>

<p>"That's my affair. I don't want to see the circus.
I consider it a wicked snare to lure souls to Satan."</p>

<p>"But I don't; you can go, you know," suggested
Spriggins.</p>

<p>"No; I shall stay here to see that you do your
duty."</p>

<p>"You have no charge over me," said the constable,
with some spirit.</p>

<p>"All the same you need looking after. Enoch,
if you defy the law you'll find it the worse for you.
This ain't Norway."</p>

<p>"No; we've got no such fools as you in Norway,"
retorted the giant. "Tell me what you
want."</p>

<p>Tarbox whispered to Spriggins.</p>

<p>The latter in a tremulous voice said, "Enoch, I
arrest you in the name of the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts, and I require you to come with me
at once."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span></p>

<p>"Come and take me," said Anak, his broad face
relaxing with a smile.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked Tarbox, quickly.</p>

<p>"I mean that I shan't stir from this chair. My
contract with this show requires me to sit here.
If the constable wants me, he must take me by
force. He needn't be afraid. If he can take me
he may."</p>

<p>Even Tarbox looked rather nonplussed. Both
he and Spriggins together would have found it
impossible to carry off a giant weighing over four
hundred pounds.</p>

<p>"You see, we'll have to give it up," said Spriggins,
with evident pleasure.</p>

<p>"You're glad of it!" said Tarbox, suspiciously.
"You don't want to do your duty."</p>

<p>"I've tried to do it, and it's no use," said the
constable, with a little show of spirit. "If I had
the strength of a yoke of oxen, I might do something;
as it is, I can't."</p>

<p>"You'd better come quietly, Enoch," said Tarbox,
his own courage beginning to fail.</p>

<p>A crowd had collected about the two, and derisive
smiles and remarks greeted the lamentable
failure of Tarbox's scheme of revenge.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span></p>

<p>"Get a wheelbarrow, mister," said a boy from
a neighboring town.</p>

<p>"Hadn't you better try a derrick?" suggested a
man beside him.</p>

<p>"You must be a lunatic!" said another.</p>

<p>"We'd better go, Mr. Tarbox," said Spriggins,
uncomfortably.</p>

<p>"I won't stir," said Tarbox, looking around him
with a scowl, "till I see that warrant served. I
wish I was a constable."</p>

<p>"It wouldn't be healthy for you, old man!" said
Charlie Davis, who, with Robert, had been drawn
to the scene, and heard the colloquy.</p>

<p>"I'd make you healthy if I had you with me
for a few minutes," said Tarbox, scowling.</p>

<p>"Thank you; you're very kind, but my time is
too valuable," said Charlie.</p>

<p>"What is all this?" asked a voice of authority.</p>

<p>It was the voice of the manager, who had
been attracted by the crowd as he was going his
rounds.</p>

<p>"The matter is that we've got a warrant for
this man's arrest!" said Tarbox, pointing to the
giant.</p>

<p>"Show me your warrant!"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span></p>

<p>It was handed him.</p>

<p>He smiled as he read it, and handing it back,
remarked, "Your warrant is mere waste paper,
gentlemen."</p>

<p>"Why is it?" asked Tarbox, defiantly.</p>

<p>"Because there is no such man as Enoch in this
show."</p>

<p>"Isn't that his name?" asked Tarbox.</p>

<p>"No, it isn't. If you can find a man by that
name you are welcome to take him."</p>

<p>"Crushed again," remarked Charlie Davis,
mockingly.</p>

<p>Tarbox made a grab for the boy's collar, but
failed to secure him.</p>

<p>"Come along out, Spriggins," he said, in a tone
of deep depression.</p>

<p>"You can go if you like," said the constable, independently;
"I'm going to stay and see the
show."</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br />
<span class="small">THE EVENING ENTERTAINMENT.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="caps">N<span class="upper">athan Tarbox</span> was not a liberal man.
Indeed he had the reputation of being very
close-fisted and mean. Never had he been known
to invite a friend to a place of amusement, never
had he been willing to incur the expense of a dime
for another. Yet here he had paid fifty cents for
a ticket of admission to the circus, and presented it
to the constable. We know, however, why he did
this. He saw no other way of compassing his revenge
upon the giant who had so grievously offended
him, and revenge even outweighed money
in his eyes.</p>

<p>Well, it had turned out a failure. In spite of
the cowardice of Spriggins something might have
been accomplished, and at all events the Norwegian
might have been put in the attitude of a
man defying the law, which would have made the
eventual penalty greater. But there had been a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
ridiculous error in the warrant&mdash;an error for
which he was compelled to admit that he himself
was responsible. Thus he was balked of his vengeance,
for the time being at least, and he was a
dollar out of pocket. That Spriggins should deliberately
disobey him and stay to see the show
was aggravating. He would rather have thrown
the money away.</p>

<p>"Goin' to stay and see the show!" repeated
Tarbox, angrily. "You can't do it, Spriggins."</p>

<p>"Why can't I?"</p>

<p>"I didn't buy you the ticket for no such purpose."</p>

<p>"Can't help that, Mr. Tarbox. I should be a
fool to leave the show, now I'm in, and my ticket
paid for."</p>

<p>"Then, Mr. Spriggins, I shall expect you to repay
me the fifty cents I spent for your ticket."</p>

<p>"You must excuse me, Mr. Tarbox; you paid
me in. I didn't ask you to, but now I'm in I'm
goin' to stay. I wouldn't have come to pay my own
ticket, for I'm a poor man, and I can't afford it."</p>

<p>"Do you think I can afford to throw away a
dollar on two tickets?" demanded the farmer,
angrily.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span></p>

<p>"I should say you could if you wanted to.
You're pretty well off, and if I was as rich as you
I wouldn't mind goin' to anything that comes
round."</p>

<p>"You don't know anything about my circumstances.
Besides I guess they'll give me my
money back, if I tell 'em how I was deceived into
buyin' tickets."</p>

<p>"Ask them, if you want to. If they'll do it,
I'll go out."</p>

<p>The two made their way to the portal, and Tarbox
said to the ticket-taker: "I only came in on
business; I didn't come to see the show. I want
to know if I can get my money back."</p>

<p>"Of course not," said that official.</p>

<p>"But I came in on business connected with the
law."</p>

<p>"Can't help it! You've seen part of the show
already; I saw you lookin' at the curiosities."</p>

<p>"I wanted to arrest one of the curiosities," said
Tarbox, indignantly. "I wouldn't give two cents
to see 'em all."</p>

<p>"Then if you're an enemy of the show, you
can't expect any passes. Just stand aside and let
people pass."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span></p>

<p>Tarbox was utterly disgusted. He was baffled
at every turn. If he only had been concerned he
would not have minded so much, but that Spriggins
should pass an evening of enjoyment at his
expense rankled in his breast.</p>

<p>"We'll go out anyhow," said he to the constable.</p>

<p>"You can do as you please, Mr. Tarbox. I'm
goin' in to get a seat and see the show."</p>

<p>"Your conduct is disgraceful, constable. You
ain't fit for your position."</p>

<p>"I shall do as I please," said Spriggins, independently.
"If you choose to let the show keep
your money, and you get nothing for it, you may.
I ain't such a fool. They'd be glad if all would do
the same. All they want is the money."</p>

<p>This argument made an impression upon the
farmer. As he couldn't get his money back, it
did seem worth while to get some value for it.
Besides, if the truth must be told, he had some
curiosity to see the performance. Never in all his
life had he been to a circus, and he always spoke
of them as sinful; still he wanted to know what
they were like.</p>

<p>"I don't know but you're right, constable," he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
said. "I don't hold to enconragin' such demoralizin'
sights, but on the other hand I don't want to
do 'em a favor by makin' 'em a present of a dollar
for a free gift. I feel obliged to stay, situated as
I am."</p>

<p>"That's the way to look at it," said the constable,
gratified at the change in his companion's
sentiments. "Come and let's get seats, so we can
see what's goin' on."</p>

<p>He led the way and Tarbox followed him. They
succeeded in obtaining favorable seats, notwithstanding
it was within five minutes of the time
for beginning the varied list of performances.</p>

<p>It must be admitted that Mr. Tarbox was interested,
in spite of himself, in the successive
features of the entertainment. I do not propose
to describe them in detail. I advance to one in
which one of our characters takes part.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen and ladies," said the manager, "I
will now introduce to your notice Robert Rudd,
the champion bareback rider of his age in the
world."</p>

<p>A horse was led into the ring, and Robert,
dressed in tights and a showy costume, bounded
into the ring also.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span></p>

<p>The horse was started. He ran along by the
side of it; then, laying his hand upon the animal,
vaulted upon his back. After riding round the
ring once or twice he rose to his feet and maintained
his position with perfect ease while the
horse, stimulated by the crack of the whip, galloped
round the course.</p>

<p>"I declare, that beats all!" said Spriggins, who
had never attended a circus before.</p>

<p>"That's the boy that was with the giant," said
Tarbox.</p>

<p>"Well, he's a smart rider. I never saw the beat
of him."</p>

<p>Mr. Spriggins was destined to be still more
astonished. Hoops were brought and placed at
regular intervals, covered with paper, and the boy
rider jumped through each in succession, landing
again on the horse's back.</p>

<p>"Did you ever see anything like it before, Mr.
Tarbox?" asked the constable.</p>

<p>"No, and I never want to again," said Tarbox,
with a growl, though he regarded the boy's performance
with as eager curiosity as his companion.</p>

<p>"I think it's beautiful," said Spriggins; "I'm
glad we come."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span></p>

<p>"I dare say you do, as long as I pay the bills,"
said Tarbox, in a sarcastic voice.</p>

<p>"Don't you like it yourself?"</p>

<p>"I don't care anything for it. I only stayed
because I didn't want the show people to get the
advantage of us."</p>

<p>Robert finished his act, and at his exit was
greeted with a storm of applause.</p>

<p>He was followed by the younger boy, Charlie
Davis, who went through a similar performance,
and was received with similar favor. Young performers
generally win the favor of an audience,
and their efforts to please are received with considerable
indulgence, though on the present occasion
this was not needed.</p>

<p>On two reserved seats sat an old gentleman
whose seamed face and bleached hair indicated
advanced years. By his side sat a man of thirty-five,
with a dark face and keen, watchful black
eyes, whose expression was not likely to prepossess
a stranger in his favor. The lines about his mouth
indicated a hard, selfish man, whose thoughts were
centred in himself.</p>

<p>This much by way of introduction. I need only
add that the first impressions likely to be formed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
of this man were the correct ones. To the old
man who sat at his side, and whom he regarded
watchfully, he bore the relation of nephew.</p>

<p>It was perhaps surprising to see at the circus a
man as old as Cornelius Richmond, for this was
the name of the uncle, but he had been persuaded
by his nephew, Hugo, with whom he was travelling,
to attend, and, as the only alternative was an
evening at a dull hotel, he yielded. But during
the first part of the performance he looked on in
a listless manner, not seeming interested. Hugo,
who was younger, appeared more attentive. But
when Robert Rudd bounded into the ring, the old
man started, and leaning forward, said quickly, in
a tone not free from agitation, "Do you see that
boy, Hugo?"</p>

<p>Hugo, too, seemed struck by the boy's appearance,
but he answered with studied indifference,
"Yes, uncle, I see him. What of him?"</p>

<p>"Is he not the image of my dead son? Never
have I seen such a resemblance to what Julian
was at his age!"</p>

<p>"My dear uncle," said Hugo, shrugging his
shoulders, "I assure you that it is all a fancy on
your part. To me he looks very unlike my cousin."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span></p>

<p>"You don't remember him as I do, Hugo. If
Julian's son were living, he would look like that
boy."</p>

<p>"Possibly, uncle," said Hugo, carelessly; "but
as he is dead that cannot interest us!"</p>

<p>While Robert was in the ring the old man followed
him with a glance almost painful in its
eagerness.</p>

<span class="small">A SCHEMING NEPHEW.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="caps">W<span class="upper">hen</span> Robert left the ring, the old man sank
back into his seat, and his interest in the performance
ceased. For some reason his nephew
also was anxious to leave the tent.</p>

<p>"Uncle," he said, "hadn't we better go back to
the hotel? It will be too fatiguing for you to remain
here all the evening."</p>

<p>"Will that boy ride again?" asked Mr. Richmond,
eagerly.</p>

<p>"No, he is not to appear again."</p>

<p>"Then I think I will go. As you say, I may
feel fatigued."</p>

<p>There was a hack in waiting to convey them
back to the hotel, for the distance was too great
for a feeble old man to walk.</p>

<p>When they reached the hotel, Mr. Richmond
went at once to his chamber, attended by his
nephew.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span></p>

<p>"You had better go to bed at once, uncle," said
Hugo, and he prepared to leave the room.</p>

<p>"Stay a moment, Hugo. I want to speak to
you," said the old man.</p>

<p>"Very well, uncle," and Hugo seated himself.</p>

<p>"The sight of that boy has affected me strangely,
Hugo," said Mr. Richmond. "He seems just
what Julian was at his age."</p>

<p>"You said so before, uncle," said Hugo, in a
tone of annoyance; "but I assure you there is
nothing in it. My eyes are better than yours, and
I could see no likeness."</p>

<p>"Suppose Julian's child were living," proceeded
Mr. Richmond, not heeding his nephew's last
speech, "he would be about the age of that
boy."</p>

<p>"There are tens of thousands of boys about the
same age, uncle," said Hugo, flippantly.</p>

<p>"Yes, but they haven't his look," returned the
old man, shrewdly.</p>

<p>"Really, uncle, you are troubling yourself to no
purpose. The son of Julian died when he was
four years old, as Fitzgerald reported to us."</p>

<p>"He might be mistaken. If he only were!" exclaimed
the old man, with deep emotion. "How<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
bright my few remaining years would be if I had
Julian's son with me!"</p>

<p>"No doubt. But he is dead, and we may as
well give up all thoughts of such a possibility.
Besides, uncle, you have me, and I try to do all I
can for you. If I have failed, I deeply regret it,"
continued Hugo, assuming a tone of sorrow.</p>

<p>"No, no; I have no fault to find with you,
Hugo," said his uncle, hastily. "You are devoted
to me, as I am well aware; but you cannot be to
me what a son or a grandson might be."</p>

<p>"No, I suppose not," said Hugo, with a sneer
which his uncle did not detect. "But I am
afraid, uncle, you will have to be content with my
humble services, however unacceptable they may
be."</p>

<p>"Nay, Hugo, I do not mean to mortify you. I
am truly grateful for your devotion, and you will
find it to be so when I am gone."</p>

<p>"You are a long time going!" thought Hugo,
as his cold glance rested on the trembling form of
his uncle. "It is exasperating that you should
linger so, cutting me off perhaps for half a dozen
years longer from the enjoyment of the estate
which is one day to be mine."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span></p>

<p>It was well that the old man could not read
the thoughts of the man in whom he placed so
much confidence. He little knew the cold, crafty,
scheming character of the man who supplied to
him the place of son and grandson.</p>

<p>"If you have no more to say, uncle, I will leave
you," said Hugo, rising.</p>

<p>"I came near forgetting. I want you to find
out all about that boy and let me know. The
manager boards at this hotel."</p>

<p>"Still harping on the boy!" muttered Hugo.
"Very well, uncle, I will do as you say."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Hugo. I shall feel more easy in
mind when I have learned."</p>

<p>As Hugo left the room, he said to himself, "I
will do as my uncle requests, but for my own
benefit, not his. Though I would not confess it
to him, the resemblance to my cousin is startling.
I don't wonder Uncle Cornelius noticed it. Can
it be possible that Fitzgerald deceived me, and
that the boy is really alive, and is a bareback
circus-rider? He is capable of playing me false.
If he has done so, I must at all hazards prevent
my uncle finding it out. The estate of Chestnutwood,
for which I have schemed so long, must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
mine. The life of a frail old man alone separates
me from it now, but if this boy were found, then
I should sink back to my life of humble dependence.
It shall never be!"</p>

<p>It was not yet 10 o'clock, and Hugo was in no
mood for bed. He went down-stairs and remained
in the bar room till the return of the hotel
guests who were connected with the circus.</p>

<p>Towards 10.30, Mr. Coleman, proprietor of the
circus, entered the office of the hotel. He was in
good spirits, for there had been a large attendance
at the first performance, and the prospects of a
successful season were flattering.</p>

<p>"Good evening, Mr. Coleman," said Hugo,
approaching the manager, to whom he had been
introduced; "did your first performance pass off
well?"</p>

<p>"It was immense, sir, immense! I am proud
of Crampton! It has received me royally," returned
the manager, enthusiastically.</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear it. May I offer you a cigar?"</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir."</p>

<p>"You will find mine choicer than any you can
procure here. I spent a part of the evening at
the tent."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span></p>

<p>"I hope you didn't get tired."</p>

<p>"Oh, no; that was not the cause of my coming
away. The fact is, my uncle, who was with me,
became fatigued (he is a very old man), and I felt
obliged to come home with him. I should have
been glad to stay till the close."</p>

<p>"It's a pity you did. Coleman's circus, though
I do say it myself, has no superior on the road
this season."</p>

<p>"I can easily believe it, sir. By the way, I was
rather interested in the bareback riding."</p>

<p>"It takes everywhere. I have two of the smartest
boy riders in the country."</p>

<p>"Where did you pick them up?" asked Hugo,
with assumed carelessness.</p>

<p>"The younger one, Charlie Davis, comes from
Canada."</p>

<p>"My attention was particularly attracted to the
other."</p>

<p>"Robert Rudd?"</p>

<p>"Yes, if that is his name. How long has he
been with you?"</p>

<p>"Two seasons. Before that he was with another
smaller circus."</p>

<p>"How long has he been riding?"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span></p>

<p>"Ever since he was eight or nine years old.
That boy is perfectly fearless with horses. Not
many grown men can ride as well. And that isn't
all! I could easily make a lion tamer of him if he
were willing. He has a wonderful power over
the wild beasts. I believe he would go into their
cages and they wouldn't offer to harm him."</p>

<p>"My cousin Julian had a passion for horses,"
thought Hugo. "If this boy were his son he
would come honestly by his taste."</p>

<p>"You don't know how he came to adopt such a
life, do you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No; I believe the boy was alone in the world.
I have heard him say he was under the care of a
man who called himself his uncle, but for whom
he does not seem to entertain any affection.
Whether this man deserted him, or he ran away
from the man, I don't know. At any rate he fell
in with some men in our business, and a well-known
rider, seeing that the boy was quick and
daring, offered to instruct him in his special line.
The boy accepted, and that is the way he drifted
into the show business."</p>

<p>"You say he has no relatives?"</p>

<p>"None that he knows of."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span></p>

<p>"Has he any education?"</p>

<p>"He can read and write, and I believe he knows
something of arithmetic. He is smart enough, if
he ever got an opportunity, to learn. I am selfish,
however, and should not like to lose him, though
I might consent if he could better himself. You
see, sir, although I am in the show business myself,
I don't consider it a very desirable career for a
boy to follow. I've got a boy of my own, but I
have placed him at boarding-school, and he shall
never, with my permission, join a circus. You'll
think it strange, Mr. Richmond, but so far as I
know, Henry has never yet witnessed a circus performance."</p>

<p>"I quite agree with you, Mr. Coleman," said
Hugo. "Then I offer you another cigar."</p>

<p>"Thanks, but I never smoke but one just before
going to bed. If you are here to-morrow evening
I shall be glad to offer you a ticket to the show."</p>

<p>"Thank you, but I must get away to-morrow
with my uncle."</p>

<p>As Hugo went up-stairs to his room he said to
himself, "It is high time we left the place, for
the manager's story leads me to think this boy
may be my cousin's son after all. My uncle must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
never know or suspect it, or my hopes of an inheritance
are blasted."</p>

<p>The next morning when Hugo entered his
uncle's apartment, according to custom, the old
man asked eagerly, "Did you learn anything
about the boy, Hugo?"</p>

<p>"Yes, uncle, I learned all about him. He was
born in Montreal, and his father and mother live
there now. He sends them half his earnings
regularly. His name&mdash;that is, his real name&mdash;is
Oliver Brown."</p>

<p>Mr. Richmond never thought of doubting the
truth of this smoothly-told fiction, but he was
greatly disappointed. He sighed deeply, and
when Hugo proposed to continue their journey
that day he made no objection.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.<br />
<span class="small">TWO BOYS ON A TRAMP.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="caps">"M<span class="upper">r. Tarbox</span>, where on earth have you
been?" inquired his wife, when her liege
lord returned about 11.30 o'clock.</p>

<p>"I've been to the circus," said the farmer
shortly.</p>

<p>"Oh, why didn't you take me, Nathan? I've
always wanted to go to the circus," said Mrs. Tarbox
in a tone of disappointment.</p>

<p>"It isn't a fit place for you," said her husband.</p>

<p>"You went!" said his wife, significantly. "If
it's a fit place for you, why isn't it for me?"</p>

<p>"Do you think I went there for pleasure?
You ought to know me better than to suppose I
would visit such a demoralizing spectacle for
amusement."</p>

<p>"Then why did you go?"</p>

<p>"I went to arrest that brute who kicked Bruiser
to death and assaulted me. That's why I went."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span></p>

<p>"Did he feel bad when you arrested him?"
asked Mrs. Tarbox, with natural curiosity.</p>

<p>"No; I had to defer it, for the warrant wasn't
rightly made out."</p>

<p>"Dear me! Did it take all the evening?"
asked his wife.</p>

<p>"Peace, woman! You ask too many questions,"
said Tarbox, who found it rather difficult
to explain matters.</p>

<p>"It must have been so nice to see the circus,"
murmured Mrs. Tarbox; "but I am sure I should
have been afraid of the giant."</p>

<p>"There was a fat woman," growled Tarbox,
"who looked as silly as you do. I dare say she
wasn't, though."</p>

<p>"How funny you are. Nathan!" said his wife,
who wasn't at all sensitive. "How was she
dressed?"</p>

<p>"How on earth should I know? She didn't
wear a coat and pantaloons."</p>

<p>"It must take a sight of calico to make her a
dress. How much does she weigh?"</p>

<p>"Two tons, more or less," answered Tarbox.</p>

<p>"Good gracious!" ejaculated his simple-minded
wife. "I never heard the like. Do let me go to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
the circus, husband. I should so like to see
her."</p>

<p>"You might never come back alive. There's
lions, and tigers and wild cats all around. They
often break out of their cages and kill a dozen
people before they can be stopped."</p>

<p>Mrs. Tarbox turned pale and gave up her idea
of going to the circus.</p>

<p>"You'd make a nice meal for a tiger. They're
fond of bones," continued the farmer, grimly.</p>

<p>"O, Nathan, don't say another word. I
wouldn't go now if I could get in for nothing."</p>

<p>The next day, after a consultation with Squire
Price and the constable, Mr. Tarbox concluded
that it wouldn't be worth while to obtain a new
warrant for the arrest of the giant, as he had
reason to believe that Mr. Spriggins would go out
of town to avoid serving it. It was hard to give
up his cherished scheme of vengeance, particularly
as he had already expended a dollar in vain;
but there seemed no alternative.</p>

<p>"One thing I can do," he said to himself; "if I
can get hold of that boy that was with Enoch I'll
give him a thrashing. He trespassed on my
grounds, and I saw him laugh when the brute
kicked Bruiser. I can manage him, anyway."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span></p>

<p>There was no afternoon performance at the circus
except on Wednesday and Saturday, and Robert
and his friend Charlie Davis were at leisure.</p>

<p>"Let's go on a tramp, Charlie," said Robert,
after they had eaten dinner.</p>

<p>"I'm with you," said Charlie. "Where shall
we go?"</p>

<p>"Oh, well, we'll go across the fields. Perhaps
we'll go into the woods. Anything for fun."</p>

<p>The two boys set out about two o'clock, and
after reaching the borders of the village took a
path across the fields.</p>

<p>"I wish nuts were ripe, Rob," said Charlie.
"We'd have a nice time knocking them off the
trees. Do you remember last fall up in Maine?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but it's June now, and we can't have any
fun of that kind. However, we can have a good
time. Do you see those bars?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I'm going to vault over them."</p>

<p>"All right. I'll follow."</p>

<p>Robert ran swiftly, and cleared the bars without
touching them. Charlie followed, but, being
a shorter boy, felt obliged to let his hand rest on
the upper bar. They were accustomed to springing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
from the ring upon the backs of horses, and
practice had made that easy to them which was
difficult for ordinary boys.</p>

<p>"I say, Charlie," said Robert, thoughtfully, as
they subsided into a walk, "what are you going
to do when you are a man?"</p>

<p>"Ride, I suppose."</p>

<p>"In the circus?"</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"I don't think I shall."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"I don't want to be a circus rider all my life."</p>

<p>"I should think you would. Ain't you the Boy
Wonder?"</p>

<p>"I shan't be the Boy Wonder when I'm twenty-five
years old."</p>

<p>"You can't make so much money any other
way."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not; but money isn't everything I
think of. I would like to get a better education
and settle down to some regular business."</p>

<p>"There's more fun in circus riding," said
Charlie, who was not as thoughtful a boy as his
companion.</p>

<p>"I don't see much fun in it," said Robert. "It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
is exciting, I know, but it's dangerous. Any day,
if your nerves are not steady, you are likely to fall
and break a limb, and then good-by to your
riding."</p>

<p>"There's no use in thinking about that."</p>

<p>"I think there is. What could we do if we had
to give up riding?"</p>

<p>"Oh, something would turn up," said Charlie,
who was of an easy disposition. "We might take
tickets or keep the candy stand."</p>

<p>"That wouldn't be very good employment for
a man. No, Charlie, I think this will be my last
season at circus riding."</p>

<p>"What will you do?"</p>

<p>"I am saving money so that, at the end of the
season, I can have something to keep me while
I am looking round."</p>

<p>"You don't say so, Rob! How much have you
saved up?"</p>

<p>"I've got about two hundred dollars saved up
already."</p>

<p>Charlie whistled.</p>

<p>"I had no idea you were so rich," he said.
"Why, I haven't got five dollars."</p>

<p>"You might have. You are paid enough."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, it goes some way. I guess I'll begin to
save, too."</p>

<p>"I wish you would. Then if you want to leave
the circus at the end of the season we'll go somewhere
together, and look for a different kind of
work. We can take a room together in Boston or
New York, eat at the restaurants, and look for
something."</p>

<p>"I don't know but I should like going to New
York," said Charlie.</p>

<p>By this time they had reached the edge of the
woods, and were probably a mile or more from
the town. There was no underbrush, but the
trees rose clear and erect, and presented a cool and
pleasant prospect to the boys, who had become
warm with walking. So far as they knew, they
were alone, but in this they were mistaken. Mr.
Tarbox had some wood-land near by, and he had
gone out to look at it, when, alike to his surprise
and gratification, his eyes rested on the two boys,
whom he at once recognized as belonging to the
circus, having seen them ride the evening before.
He didn't care particularly for Charlie Davis, but
Robert Rudd had been with Anak when he inflicted
upon him so mortifying personal chastisement,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
and he looked upon the boy as an accomplice
of the man.</p>

<p>"That's the very boy I wanted to see," said
Tarbox to himself, with a cruel smile. "I can't
manage that overgrown brute, but I can manage
him. I'll give the boy a lesson, and that'll be
better than nothing."</p>

<p>Tarbox was naturally a tyrant and a bully, and,
like most men of his character, was delighted
when he could get hold of a person of inferior
strength.</p>

<p>"Oh ho!" he said to himself, "the boy can't
escape me now."</p>

<p>"Look here, boy," he said, in an impatient
tone.</p>

<p>Robert turned quickly, and saw the frowning
face of Tarbox.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER X.<br />
<span class="small">TRAPPED.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="caps">R<span class="upper">obert</span> foresaw that trouble was in store for
him, as he had seen enough of the farmer to
understand his disposition. However, the boy
was not easily startled, nor was he of a nervous
temperament. He looked calmly at Tarbox and
said: "Very well, sir, what do you want of me?"</p>

<p>"What do I want of you? I shouldn't think
you'd need to be told. You remember me, don't
you?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly well," answered Robert.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you can remember where you saw me
last?"</p>

<p>"In the circus last evening."</p>

<p>"No, I don't mean that&mdash;before that."</p>

<p>"In your own field, trying to whip a poor boy
who was going to call the doctor for his sick
mother."</p>

<p>"Look here, boy," said Tarbox, reddening;
"none of your impudence!"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span></p>

<p>"Did I tell the truth?" asked Robert quietly.</p>

<p>"Never mind whether you did or not. I ain't
going to stand any of your impudence. Where's
that big brute Enoch?"</p>

<p>"If you mean Anak, I left him in the tent."</p>

<p>"He needn't think he can go round insulting
and committing assault and battery on his betters,"
said Tarbox.</p>

<p>"You can tell him that if you like, sir; I am
not responsible for him."</p>

<p>"No, but you are responsible for trespassin' on
my grounds."</p>

<p>"I would do it again if I saw you trying to
flog a defenceless boy," said Robert, independently.</p>

<p>"You would, hey?" sneered Tarbox. "Well,
now, you may change your opinion on that subject
before we part company."</p>

<p>"Come, Rob, let's be going," said Charlie
Davis, who didn't find this conversation interesting.</p>

<p>"You can go," said Tarbox; "I hav'nt anything
ag'inst you; but this boy's got to stay."</p>

<p>"What for?" asked Charlie.</p>

<p>"What for? He'll find out what for."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span></p>

<p>"If you touch him, I'll send Anak after you,"
said Charlie.</p>

<p>"You will, hey? So you are impudent, too.
Well, I'll have to give you a lesson, too."</p>

<p>Tarbox felt that it was time to commence business,
and made a grab for Robert's collar, but
the boy was agile, and quickly dodging ran to one
side.</p>

<p>Charlie Davis laughed, which further annoyed
and provoked Mr. Tarbox, but the wrath of the
farmer was chiefly directed against Robert, who
had witnessed his discomfiture at the hands of
the Norwegian giant. He therefore set out to
catch the young circus-rider, but Robert was fleet-footed,
and led him a fruitless chase around trees,
and Tarbox was not able to get his hand on him.
What annoyed the farmer especially was that the
boy did not seem at all frightened, and it appeared
to be no particular effort to him to elude
his grasp.</p>

<p>Tarbox was of a dogged, determined disposition,
and the more difficult he found it to carry
out his purpose the more resolved he was to accomplish
it. It would never do to yield to two
boys, who both together had less strength than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
he. It was different from encountering Anak,
who was a match for three ordinary men.</p>

<p>But Tarbox, in spite of his anger, and in spite
of his superior strength, was destined to come to
grief.</p>

<p>He had not paid any special attention to the
younger boy, being intent upon capturing Robert.
Charlie, taking advantage of this, picked up a
stout stick, which had apparently been cut for a
cane and then thrown aside, and took it up first
with the intention of defending himself, if necessary.
But as Tarbox dashed by without noticing
him, a new idea came to Charlie, and thrusting
out the stick so that it passed between the legs of
the pursuer, Tarbox was thrown violently to the
ground, on which he lay for a moment prostrate
and bewildered.</p>

<p>"Climb that tree, Rob!" called out Charlie
quickly.</p>

<p>Robert accepted the suggestion. He saw that
no time was to be lost, and with the quickness of
a trained athlete made his way up the trunk and
into the branches of a tall tree near at hand, while
Charlie with equal quickness took refuge on
another.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span></p>

<p>Tarbox fell with such violence that he was
jarred and could not immediately recover from
the shock of his fall. When he did rise he was
more angry than ever. He looked for the two
boys and saw what had become of them. By this
time Robert was at least twenty-five feet from
the ground.</p>

<p>"Come down here, you, sir!" said the farmer,
his voice shaking with passion.</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," answered Robert coolly;
"but at present I find it more agreeable up here."</p>

<p>"Come down here, and I'll give you the worst
thrashing you ever had!"</p>

<p>"Your intentions are very kind, but the inducement
isn't sufficient."</p>

<p>"If I hadn't fallen just as I did, I'd have had
you by this time."</p>

<p>"That's just what I thought when I put the
stick between your legs," called out Charlie Davis
from another tree.</p>

<p>It may seem singular, but until then Tarbox
had not understood how he came to fall. He had
an idea that he had tripped over the root of a tree.</p>

<p>"Did you do that?" he asked wrathfully, turning
to the smaller boy.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, I did."</p>

<p>"If I could catch you, you wouldn't get out of
this wood alive."</p>

<p>"Then I'm glad you can't get me," said Charlie,
looking unconcernedly down upon his stalwart
enemy.</p>

<p>"You're two of the worst boys I ever saw,"
proceeded the farmer, wrathfully.</p>

<p>"And I'm sure you're the worst man I ever saw."</p>

<p>"What's your name?" asked Tarbox, abruptly.</p>

<p>"Charlie Davis; I'm sorry I haven't got my
card with me, or I'd throw it down to you."</p>

<p>"I'd like to have the bringing up of you."</p>

<p>"All right! Perhaps I'll appoint you my guardian."</p>

<p>"You're more impudent than the other one,
though you ain't so big."</p>

<p>"Are you comin' down?" he inquired of Robert.</p>

<p>"Not at present."</p>

<p>"I won't stir from here till you do, if I have to
stay all night."</p>

<p>This was not a cheerful reflection, for the two
boys were expected to be present and ride in the
evening, and their absence would be regretted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
not only by the manager, but also by the public,
with whom they were favorites.</p>

<p>"I say, Rob," called out Charlie, "how fond
he is of our company!"</p>

<p>"So it seems!" responded Robert, who was
quite cool but rather annoyed by the farmer's persistence.</p>

<p>"I only wish Bruiser were alive!" said Tarbox.
"Then I'd know what to do."</p>

<p>"What would you do?" asked Charlie.</p>

<p>"I'd leave him to guard you, and then I'd go
home and get my gun."</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"I'd soon bring you down if I had that," answered
the farmer, grimly.</p>

<p>"If that's what you would do I'm glad old
Bruiser's kicked the bucket," said Charlie.</p>

<p>"I never shall get such another dog!" said
Tarbox, half to himself, in a mournful voice.
"Nobody dared to go across my ground when he
was alive."</p>

<p>"Was that the dog that Anak killed?" asked
Charlie.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Robert, briefly. "He was a
vicious-looking brute and deserved to die."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span></p>

<p>At that moment Tarbox chanced to notice the
stick which had produced his downfall, and a new
idea came to him.</p>

<p>He picked it up, and breaking it in two seized
one piece and flung it with all his force at Robert.</p>

<p>The latter caught and flung it back, knocking off
the farmer's hat.</p>

<p>Tarbox was naturally incensed, and began again
to hurl the missile, but anger disturbed his aim so
that this time it went wide of the mark.</p>

<p>"I say, Robert," said Charlie, "this is interesting."</p>

<p>"I'm glad you find it so," answered Robert.
"I can't say I enjoy it."</p>

<p>"You may just as well come down and take
your thrashing now," said Tarbox, "for you're
sure to get it."</p>

<p>"If you're in a hurry to get home to supper,
perhaps we'll wait for you here," suggested
Charlie, politely.</p>

<p>"Shut up, you saucebox! You won't have
much appetite for supper!" retorted Tarbox.</p>

<p>He sat down where he could have a full view
of both trees, when presently he heard Charlie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
call out in a terrified tone, "Rob, look there!
The tiger's got loose! See him coming this way!
Can he climb trees?"</p>

<p>Tarbox stopped to hear no more. He sprang
to his feet, and without waiting to bid the boys
good-by he took to his heels and fled from the
wood, feeling that his life was in peril.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XI.<br />
<span class="small">DISMAY AT THE HOME OF TARBOX.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="caps">R<span class="upper">obert</span> quickly understood that Tarbox was
the victim of a practical joke, and did his best
to help it along. He had amused himself during
his connection with the circus in imitating the cries
of wild beasts, and now from his perch in the
tree reproduced the howl of a wolf so naturally
that Tarbox, hearing it, and knowing no better,
thought it proceeded from the throat of the tiger.
Of course he increased his speed, expecting every
moment that the dangerous animal would spring
upon him and tear him to pieces.</p>

<p>"If I only had my gun with me," he reflected
in his dismay, "I might be able to defend myself."</p>

<p>He lost his hat somewhere on the road, and
breathless and hatless entered his own back door,
shutting and bolting it after him, and with disordered
look entered the sitting-room where his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
wife was seated, in a comfortable chat with Mrs.
Dunlap, a neighbor.</p>

<p>Tarbox sank into a rocking-chair, and, gasping,
stared at the two ladies.</p>

<p>"Good gracious, Nathan!" exclaimed his wife,
in a flutter; "what on earth has happened?"</p>

<p>"Was anything chasin' ye?" asked Mrs. Dunlap,
unconsciously hitting the mark.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Tarbox, in a hollow voice.</p>

<p>"Was it the Norwegian giant?" inquired Mrs.
Tarbox, apprehensively.</p>

<p>"Worse!" answered Tarbox, sententiously.</p>

<p>"Worse! Do tell. Good gracious, Nathan, I
shall go into a fit if you don't tell me right off
what it was."</p>

<p>"It was a tiger!" answered her husband, impressively.</p>

<p>"A tiger!" exclaimed both ladies, startled and
affrighted.</p>

<p>"Yes, I've had a narrow escape of my life."</p>

<p>"But where did he come from?" asked Mrs.
Dunlap.</p>

<p>"Come from? Where should he come from
except from the circus? He broke loose and now
he's prowling round, seeking whom he may devour.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span></p>

<p>"O heavens," exclaimed Mrs. Dunlap, terror-stricken,
"and my innocent children are out picking
berries in the pasture."</p>

<p>"Tigers are fond of children," said Tarbox,
whose hard nature found pleasure in the dismay
of the unhappy mother.</p>

<p>"I must go right home and send for the children,"
said the mother, in an agony of apprehension.</p>

<p>"You may never live to get home," said Tarbox.</p>

<p>"Oh what shall I do?" said Mrs. Dunlap, wringing
her hands. "Won't you go home with me,
Mr. Tarbox? I can't stay here with my poor
children in peril."</p>

<p>"No, I thank you. My life is worth something."</p>

<p>"You might take your gun, Nathan," said Mrs.
Tarbox, who was stirred by the grief of her friend.</p>

<p>"Oh yes," said Tarbox, sarcastically; "you're
very ready to have your husband's life exposed.
You'd like to be a widow. Maybe you think I've
left you all my property."</p>

<p>"You know, Nathan, I never thought of that.
I only thought of poor Mrs. Dunlap. Think how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
sad it would be if Jimmy and Florence Ann were
torn to pieces by the terrible tiger."</p>

<p>There was a fresh outburst of grief from the
stricken mother at the heart-rending thought, but
Mr. Tarbox was not moved.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Tarbox," said he, "if you want to see
Mrs. Dunlap home you can take the gun."</p>

<p>"Oh, I shouldn't das't to," said Mrs. Tarbox,
hastily. "I&mdash;I shouldn't know how to fire it."</p>

<p>"I think you'd be more likely to shoot Mrs. Dunlap
than the tiger," said her husband, derisively.</p>

<p>"Where did you come across the&mdash;the monster,
Nathan?" asked Mrs. Tarbox, shuddering.</p>

<p>"In the woods. I heard him roar. I ran from
there as fast as I could come, expecting every
minute he would spring upon me."</p>

<p>"Was there any one else in the wood?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Tarbox, smiling grimly.
"There's two circus boys there. They clumb into
trees. I don't know whether tigers can climb or
not. If they can they've probably made mincemeat
of the boys by this time."</p>

<p>"It's terrible!" said Mrs. Dunlap, shuddering.
"Perhaps my innocent darlings are in the clutches
of the monster at this very moment."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span></p>

<p>And the unhappy lady went into a fit of hysterics,
from which she was brought to by a strong
bottle of hartshorn held to her nose.</p>

<p>It so happened (happily for her) that her husband
at this moment knocked at the door. He
had gone home to find something, and failing had
come to the house of his neighbor to inquire of
his wife its whereabouts. Great was his amazement
to find his wife in such agitation.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" he asked, looking about
him.</p>

<p>"O Thomas, have you heard the terrible
news?" said his wife.</p>

<p>"I haven't heard any terrible news," was the
bewildered reply. "Is anybody dead?"</p>

<p>"Our two poor innocent darlings may be dead
by this time," sobbed his wife.</p>

<p>"What does it all mean? Where are they?"</p>

<p>"Out in the berry pasture. The tiger may
have caught them by this time."</p>

<p>"What tiger?"</p>

<p>"The one that's broken loose from the show."</p>

<p>"I just came from the tent, and they don't
know anything there of any tigers breaking loose.
Who told you about it?"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span></p>

<p>"Mr. Tarbox. The tiger chased him all the way
home from the woods."</p>

<p>"That is strange. Did you see him, Mr. Tarbox?"</p>

<p>"I heard him roar," answered Tarbox, "and he
was close behind me all the way."</p>

<p>"Are you sure it was a tiger?"</p>

<p>"No; it may have been a lion. Anyhow, it
was some wild critter."</p>

<p>"O husband, do go after our poor children.
And take Mr. Tarbox's gun. I am sure he will
lend it to you."</p>

<p>"I may need it myself," said Tarbox, doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Give me a stout stick, and I'll manage," said
Mr. Dunlap, who was a more courageous man
than his neighbor. "Come along, wife."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I hope, Mrs. Tarbox, we shall meet again,"
said Mrs. Dunlap, as she kissed her friend a tearful
good-by. "I don't feel sure, for we may meet
the terrible beasts."</p>

<p>"If you do," said Mrs. Tarbox, with tearful
emotion, "I'll come to your funeral."</p>

<p>Somehow this didn't seem to comfort Mrs.
Dunlap much, for when they were fairly out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
the house she observed sharply, "That woman's a
fool!"</p>

<p>"You seem to like to call on her, Lucinda."</p>

<p>"That's only being neighborly. She has no
heart or she wouldn't allude so coolly to my
funeral. But do let us be getting home as soon
as you can."</p>

<p>"I tell you what, Lucinda, I don't take any
stock in this cock-and-bull story of a tiger being
loose. I heard nothing of it at the tent."</p>

<p>"But Mr. Tarbox said it chased him."</p>

<p>"Tarbox is a coward. But here are two boys
coming; they belong to the circus. I will ask
them."</p>

<p>Robert and Charlie Davis were coming up the
road. No sooner had their enemy fled than they
descended from the trees in whose branches they
had taken refuge, and started on their way home,
laughing heartily at the farmer's fright.</p>

<p>"I say, boys," said Mr. Dunlap, "don't you two
boys belong to the circus?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," answered Robert.</p>

<p>"What's this story I hear about a tiger having
escaped from his cage?"</p>

<p>"Who told you?" asked Robert.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span></p>

<p>"Mr. Tarbox."</p>

<p>"Did he see him?"</p>

<p>"He said the tiger chased him all the way
home."</p>

<p>Both boys burst into a fit of laughter, rather to
the amazement of Mr. Dunlap and his wife. Then
they explained how the farmer had been humbugged,
and Mr. Dunlap shouted with merriment,
for Tarbox was very unpopular in that town, and
no one would feel troubled at any deception practised
upon him.</p>

<p>"Then the children are safe?" said Mrs. Dunlap,
with a sigh of relief. "Don't you think I
ought to go and tell Mr. Tarbox?"</p>

<p>"No; let Tarbox stay in the house, like a coward
that he is, for fear of the tiger. It's a good
joke at his expense. That was a pretty smart
trick, boys."</p>

<p>"Old Tarbox will feel like murdering us if he
ever finds out the truth," said Charlie.</p>

<p>"He feels so now, so far as I am concerned,"
said Robert. "I am not afraid of him."</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XII.<br />
<span class="small">THE CANVAS MAN.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="caps">W<span class="upper">hen</span> Mr. Tarbox came to understand how he
had been hoaxed by the boys he was furious,
but his anger was ineffectual, for there seemed no
way in which he could retaliate. He had had his
opportunity in the woods, but that had passed, and
was not likely to come again. Meanwhile he
found it hard to bear the jocose inquiries of
his neighbors touching his encounter with the
"tiger."</p>

<p>For instance, the next day he met the constable
in the street.</p>

<p>"How are you, Mr. Tarbox?" inquired Spriggins,
smiling.</p>

<p>"Well enough," growled Tarbox, quickening
his pace.</p>

<p>"I hear you had an adventure with a tiger yesterday,"
said the constable, with a waggish smile.</p>

<p>"Suppose I did!" he snapped.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span></p>

<p>"Ho, ho! Were you very much frightened?"
continued the constable.</p>

<p>"I wasn't half so much scared as you were when
I wanted you to arrest the giant."</p>

<p>It was the constable's turn to look embarrassed.
"Who said I was afraid?"</p>

<p>"It was enough to look at you," said Tarbox.</p>

<p>"Well, maybe I was a little flustered," admitted
Spriggins. "Who wouldn't be afraid of a man
ten feet high? They do say, Tarbox, that you
did some pretty tall running, and there wasn't no
tiger loose after all."</p>

<p>And Mr. Constable indulged in a chuckle which
irritated the farmer intensely. He resolved to retaliate.</p>

<p>"Do you know where I am goin', Spriggins?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Then I'll tell you," answered Tarbox, with a
malicious smile. "I'm goin' to Squire Price to
get another warrant for the arrest of Anak&mdash;I've
found out that that's his name&mdash;and I'm goin' to
get you to serve it."</p>

<p>The constable's countenance changed. "Don't
be foolish, Mr. Tarbox," he said.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span></p>

<p>"I understand my business, Spriggins, and I
shall expect you to do yours. I'll see you again in
half an hour."</p>

<p>"I may not be at home; I expect I've got to go
over to Medville."</p>

<p>"Then put it off. Your duty to the State is
ahead of all private business."</p>

<p>He went on his way leaving Mr. Spriggins in a
very uneasy frame of mind. When he went home
to supper, he said to his wife: "Mrs. S., after supper
I'm going up into the attic, and if Nathan
Tarbox comes round and asks for me, you say that
I'm out of town."</p>

<p>"But it wouldn't be true, Spriggins," replied
his wife.</p>

<p>"I know it won't; but he wants me to arrest the
giant, and it's as much as my life is worth," answered
the constable, desperately. "I don't think
I'm a coward, but I ain't a match for a giant."</p>

<p>The farmer, however, did not come round. He
had only made the statement to frighten Spriggins,
and retaliate upon him for his joke about
the tiger.</p>

<p>In the afternoon Robert, while out for a walk,
fell in with one of the canvas men, a rough-looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
fellow, named, or at least he called himself,
Carden. Canvas men, as may be inferred from
the name, are employed in putting up and taking
down the circus tent, and are generally an inferior
set of men, not differing much from the professional
tramp. Robert, who, in spite of his asseverations,
had considerable self-respect and proper
pride, never mingled much with them, and for
that reason was looked upon as "putting on airs."
His friend, Charlie Davis, was much more popular
with them.</p>

<p>"Hallo, Robert," said Carden, familiarly.</p>

<p>The canvas man was smoking a short, dirty clay
pipe, and would have made an admirable model
for a picture of a tramp.</p>

<p>"Hello, Carden!" said Robert, coolly.</p>

<p>"Walkin' for your health?" asked the canvas
man, in the same disagreeably familiar tone.</p>

<p>"Partly."</p>

<p>Carden was walking by his side, and Robert did
not like the familiarity which this would seem to
imply.</p>

<p>"Pretty good town, this!" continued Carden,
socially.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span></p>

<p>"Sorry I haven't another pipe to offer you, Robert,
my boy."</p>

<p>"Thank you; I shouldn't use it."</p>

<p>"Don't mean to say you don't smoke, eh, Bob?"</p>

<p>"I don't smoke."</p>

<p>"That is, not a pipe&mdash;I dare say you wouldn't
mind a cigar or cigarette, now."</p>

<p>"I don't smoke at all now. I did once, but
found it was injuring me, and gave it up."</p>

<p>"Oh, it won't hurt you. I've smoked since I
was a chap so high"&mdash;indicating a point about
three feet from the ground&mdash;"and I ain't dead
yet."</p>

<p>Robert did not reply to this, but looked around
anxiously for some pretext to leave his unwelcome
companion.</p>

<p>Just then they passed a wayside saloon.</p>

<p>"Come in, Bob, and have a drink!" said Carden,
laying his hand upon the boy's shoulder. "It'll
do you good to whet your whistle."</p>

<p>"No, thank you," said Robert, shrinking from
the man's touch.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't be foolish. A little whiskey'll do
you good."</p>

<p>"Thank you, I would rather not."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span></p>

<p>Meantime Carden was searching in his pocket
for a silver coin, but his search was fruitless.</p>

<p>"I say, Bob, I am out of tin. Come in and
treat?"</p>

<p>"You must excuse me, Mr. Carden," said Robert,
coldly.</p>

<p>"Come, don't be stingy! You get good pay, and
can afford to stand treat. We poor canvas men
only have $15 a month."</p>

<p>"If this will do you any good," said Robert, producing
a silver quarter, "you are welcome to it."</p>

<p>"Thank you; you'd better come in, too."</p>

<p>Robert sacrificed the coin to regain his freedom,
as Carden's entering the saloon seemed to offer the
only mode of release.</p>

<p>"What a stuck-up young jackanapes!" muttered
Carden, as he entered the saloon. "He thinks a
deal of himself, and don't want to have nought to
do with me because I'm a poor canvas man. I
doubt he's got a good deal of money hid away
somewhere, for he don't spend much. I heard
Charlie Davis say the other day Bob had $200."</p>

<p>Carden's eyes glittered with cupidity as the
thought passed through his mind.</p>

<p>"I'd like to get hold of it," he muttered to himself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
"It would be a fortune for a poor canvas
man, and he wouldn't miss it, for he could soon
gain as much more. I wonder where he keeps
it."</p>

<p>"It's the worst of the life I lead," said Robert to
himself, as he walked on, "that I am thrown into
the company of such men as that. It isn't because
they are poor that I object to them, for I
am not rich myself; but a man needn't be low because
he is poor and earning small pay. I suppose
Carden and the other canvas men think I am
proud because I don't seek their company, but they
are mistaken. I have nothing in common with
them, except that we are all in the employ of the
same manager. Besides, I do talk with Madigan.
He is a canvas man, but he has had a good education
and is fitted for something better, and only
takes up with this rather than be idle."</p>

<p>Half an hour after, Charlie Davis joined him.</p>

<p>"Rob," said Charlie, "I met Carden, just now.
He was half drunk, and pitching into you."</p>

<p>"He ought not, for I had just lent him a quarter."</p>

<p>"He said you were too proud to drink with
him."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span></p>

<p>"That is true, though I wouldn't drink with one
I had more respect for."</p>

<p>"He asked me where you kept your money.
You'd better look out for him."</p>

<p>"I shall. I have no doubt he is capable of
robbing me, and I would rather spend my own
money myself."</p>

<p>"I'm not afraid of his robbing me," said Charlie.</p>

<p>"No, I suppose not; but I wish you would save
some of your money, so as to have something worth
stealing."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll begin to save sometime."</p>

<p>It was perhaps the thought of this conversation
that led Robert in the evening after the entertainment
was over, or rather after his part of it was
over, to walk round to one of the circus wagons,
in which, in a small closet, he kept some of his
clothing and the whole of his money.</p>

<p>As he came up he saw in the darkness the
crouching figure of a man trying the lock of his
compartment with one of a bunch of keys he held
in his hand.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XIII.<br />
<span class="small">CATCHING A THIEF.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="caps">"W<span class="upper">hat</span> are you doing here?" demanded Robert,
in a quick, imperious tone.</p>

<p>The man, like all who are engaged in a disreputable
deed, started suddenly and half rose from
his crouching position, still holding the keys in
his hand. He did not answer immediately, probably
because it was rather difficult to decide what
to say.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here?" demanded Robert,
once more.</p>

<p>"None of your business!" answered the man,
whose temper got the better of his prudence.</p>

<p>"I should think it was my business, as you
were trying to get at my property."</p>

<p>"That's a lie!" said the man, sullenly.</p>

<p>As he spoke he stepped out of the wagon, and
Robert recognized him as the canvas man, Carden,
introduced in the last chapter.</p>

<p>"It's the truth," said Robert firmly. "I know
you, Carden, and I am not much surprised. It
won't do to try it again."</p>

<p>"I've a great mind to thrash you for your impudence!"
growled Carden.</p>

<p>"I can defend myself," returned Robert, coolly,
who had plenty of courage.</p>

<p>Carden laughed derisively.</p>

<p>"What can you do?" he said. "You'd be like
a baby in my grasp."</p>

<p>"I am not afraid of you," said Robert, with
composure. "Don't come around here again."</p>

<p>"I shall go where I please," said Carden, with
the addition of an oath. "And don't you go to
telling tales of me, or I'll wring your neck."</p>

<p>Robert did not answer, but when Carden had
slunk away, opened the locker himself, and took
out a wallet filled with bills.</p>

<p>"It is imprudent to leave so much money here,"
he reflected. "If I hadn't come up just as I did,
Carden would have got hold of it. What shall I
do with it?"</p>

<p>Robert felt that it would not do to carry it
round with him, as that would be about as imprudent
as to leave it in the locker. He decided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
after a little reflection upon leaving it with the
manager of the circus, in whom he had every
confidence, and deservedly. He accordingly
sought Mr. Coleman after the entertainment was
over.</p>

<p>"Well, Robert, what is it?" asked the manager,
kindly.</p>

<p>"I have a favor to ask of you, sir."</p>

<p>"Very well; what is it?"</p>

<p>"I came near losing all my savings to-night.
Will you take charge of this wallet for me? I
don't feel safe with it in my possession."</p>

<p>"Certainly, Robert. How much money have
you here?"</p>

<p>"Two hundred dollars."</p>

<p>"Whew! You are rich. You say you came
near losing it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, to-night."</p>

<p>"How was that?"</p>

<p>Robert detailed his visit to his locker, and his
discovery of the canvas man attempting to open
it, but he mentioned no names.</p>

<p>"Which of the canvas men was it?" asked Mr.
Coleman.</p>

<p>Robert hesitated.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't want to get the man into trouble," he
said.</p>

<p>"That does you credit, but if we have a thief
with us it is important that we should know it,
for there are others whom he may try to rob."</p>

<p>From what he knew of Carden, Robert felt
that the apprehension was very well founded, and
he saw that it was his duty to mention the name
of the thief.</p>

<p>"It was Carden," he answered.</p>

<p>"The very man I suspected," said the manager.
"The other men are rough, but he looks like a
scoundrel. He came to me and begged for work,
and I engaged him, though I knew nothing about
him. I shall see him in the morning, and discharge
him."</p>

<p>The manager did not forget. The next morning
he summoned Carden, and said, quietly,
"Carden, you are no longer in my employ. I
will pay you to the end of the week, but I want
you to leave now."</p>

<p>"What's that for?" growled the canvas man,
looking ugly.</p>

<p>"It's on account of what happened last night,"
said the manager.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span></p>

<p>"Has that young fool been blabbing about
me?"</p>

<p>"I have said nothing about any one."</p>

<p>"No, but I know Robert Rudd's been telling
tales about me."</p>

<p>"He answered my questions, but said he didn't
want to get you into trouble."</p>

<p>"Of course not!" sneered Carden. "He's a
nice boy, he is; the young liar."</p>

<p>"You seem to know what he said," observed
the manager, eying the man keenly.</p>

<p>"I s'pose he said I was tryin' to rob him."</p>

<p>"He did, and I believed him."</p>

<p>"Then he lied!" said the man, fiercely. "He'll
repent the day he told tales about me."</p>

<p>"That will do, Carden," said the manager,
quietly. "Here's your money."</p>

<p>Carden went off swearing. As he was leaving
the grounds of the circus he met Robert.</p>

<p>"You've been blabbing about me. I'll fix
you," he said.</p>

<p>Robert made no reply, for he did not care to
get into a dispute with such a man.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.<br />
<span class="small">CHESTNUTWOOD.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="caps">W<span class="upper">e</span> must now change the scene to a fine estate
in the interior of New York State, near one
of the beautiful lakes which give such a charm to
the surrounding landscape.</p>

<p>The estate was a large one, laid out in the English
style, with a fine mansion centrally located
and elegantly furnished. Surely the owner of this
fine domain was worthy of envy, and ought to
have been happy.</p>

<p>Let us enter the breakfast room and make acquaintance
with him.</p>

<p>There he sits in an easy-chair, a white-haired,
shrunken old man, his face deeply lined, and wearing
a weary expression as if the world afforded him
little satisfaction.</p>

<p>It was the same old man whom we last saw in
the circus at Crampton. He had gone home with
his nephew at once, having become weary of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
travel. It was wise, perhaps; for he was old, and
to the old rest is welcome.</p>

<p>His nephew sat near by with a daily paper in
his hand, from which he appeared to have been
reading to his uncle.</p>

<p>"That will do, Hugo," said the old man. "I&mdash;I
don't find any interest in the paper this morning."</p>

<p>"How are you feeling, uncle&mdash;as well as usual?"</p>

<p>"Well in health&mdash;that is, as well as I can expect
to feel, but my life is empty. I have nothing to
live for."</p>

<p>"Why don't you die then?" thought the nephew,
but he did not express his thought. On the contrary,
he said, "Surely, uncle, you have much to
live for. You are rich, honored."</p>

<p>"But I have no one to love me, Hugo," said the
old man, plaintively, "no one of my own blood.
My son is dead, and his son&mdash;do you know, Hugo,"
he continued in a different voice, "I cannot get
out of my mind that boy we saw in the circus?"</p>

<p>Hugo shrugged his shoulder, but did not venture
to express the annoyance he felt.</p>

<p>"You mean the&mdash;the O'Connor boy," he said
indifferently.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span></p>

<p>"O'Connor!" replied his uncle, in surprise.
"You told me his name was Oliver Brown."</p>

<p>"Did I?" said Hugo, flushing. "Oh, well, I had
forgotten. The name didn't impress me. I
thought he was an Irish boy."</p>

<p>"You said he was born in Montreal, and that
his parents lived there now."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, no doubt you are right, uncle: you
know I didn't take as much interest in him as
you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"True, Hugo; but surely you could detect the
wonderful resemblance to my son Julian."</p>

<p>"I can't say I did, uncle; but probably we
looked at him with different eyes."</p>

<p>"That was natural. How much do you think
they pay him in the circus, Hugo?"</p>

<p>"Really, uncle, I haven't the slightest idea. I
never knew any circus people. Four or five dollars
a week, perhaps."</p>

<p>"I have been thinking, Hugo, I should like to
have that boy live with me."</p>

<p>"You can't be in earnest, uncle," said Hugo,
very disagreeably surprised.</p>

<p>"Why not? He may not be akin to me; but
he looks like my dead son, and for that resemblance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
I could come to love him. It would be a
great comfort to me to see him every day, and
have him come in and out. He might read to
me, and so relieve you of some of your duties,
Hugo."</p>

<p>"But I have never asked to be relieved of them,
uncle," said Hugo, bashfully.</p>

<p>"I know that, Hugo, but he would be company
for us both. I want you to go and bring him
back with you. You can find out how much they
pay him at the circus, and offer him more to come
here. I will give him a chance to study, engage
masters for him, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Make him your heir, I suppose," said Hugo to
himself, with a dark frown, which his uncle did
not see; "not if I am able to prevent it. My
uncle must think I am a fool to bring into the
house so dangerous a rival. After waiting so
many weary years for Chestnutwood, does he
think I am going to let it drift into the hands of
an unknown boy simply because he looks like my
cousin Julian?"</p>

<p>These thoughts passed through the mind of
Hugo Richmond, but it is needless to say that he
did not give utterance to them, or to anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
like them. His course was not to oppose strongly
any whim of his uncle, but to seemingly assent,
and then oppose it secretly, while the old man
thought him to be promoting it.</p>

<p>Nevertheless Hugo was very much annoyed at
the present caprice of his uncle, as he chose to
style it.</p>

<p>"I wish I had never gone into that circus," he
reflected, with annoyance. "Till then my uncle's
mind was at rest, and he didn't trouble himself
with the thought that Julian's son might still be
alive. Now the mischief has been done, and the
sight of that boy has upset him and endangered
my prospects. Who would have thought that
such a chance visit would have led to such results?
Well, well, it is going to give me some trouble,
but I am master of the situation, and my uncle
shall never again set eyes on that boy if I can
prevent it."</p>

<p>Hugo took his hat and went out to look after
some laborers who were at work in the rear of the
lawn, when his attention was drawn to a rather
shabby-looking figure approaching the house.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.<br />
<span class="small">A COMPACT.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="caps">H<span class="upper">ugo</span> stopped short, till the stranger should
come up. He intended to warn him off the
grounds, as an intruder.</p>

<p>"Look here, my man," he said, with an air of
authority, "are you aware that these are private
grounds?"</p>

<p>"I suppose they are," said the intruder, smiling.</p>

<p>Hugo was surprised to see that he showed no
confusion or timidity, but stood his ground boldly.
The fellow's unconcern nettled him.</p>

<p>"Then, if you suppose they are," he said,
sharply, "you must know that you are trespassing.
You can have no business here, and the best
course, if you wish to avoid trouble, is to turn
about and gain the highway as speedily as possible."</p>

<p>Hugo fancied that this would be sufficient to
put the intruder to flight, but he was mistaken.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span></p>

<p>"Who told you I had no business here?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Don't be impertinent! A man like you can
have no business here unless you wish to obtain a
position as laborer, and we have no vacancy of
that kind."</p>

<p>The intruder held out his hands and said,
quietly: "Do them look like the hands of a
laborer?"</p>

<p>Hugo glanced at them. They were as white
and unsoiled by any of the outward evidences of
manual labor as his own. Yet the man was shabbily
dressed, and looked poor. Be that as it
might, he had never been accustomed to labor
with his hands.</p>

<p>"No," answered Hugo, "but that isn't in your
favor. However, I have no further time to waste
with you. Leave these grounds at once."</p>

<p>"Not until I have had some further conversation
with you, Mr. Hugo Richmond," said the
visitor, regarding Hugo fixedly.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" demanded Hugo, abruptly.
"You know my name, it seems. Have I ever
known you?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span></p>

<p>"What is your name?"</p>

<p>"Fitzgerald."</p>

<p>"I aver that you are he," said Hugo, after a
brief glance of scrutiny, "though I should hardly
have known you. I am glad you are come. I
was wishing particularly to see you."</p>

<p>Fitzgerald looked surprised. He had fancied
that he would be an unwelcome, perhaps a dreaded
apparition, yet here was the man who he had
thought would be disturbed at his appearance
actually expressing his pleasure at meeting him.</p>

<p>"Then I am glad I came," he said. "I thought
perhaps you would be sorry to see me."</p>

<p>"So I should have been a week since. Now
something has occurred which makes a meeting
between us desirable."</p>

<p>"Is your uncle dead?" asked the visitor, with
eager interest.</p>

<p>"No, he is still living," returned Hugo, with a
half unconscious sigh of regret. "Walk with me
to yonder summer-house. I must have some serious
conversation with you."</p>

<p>Fitzgerald followed, wondering considerably
what Hugo had to say to him, and the two sat
down in a summer-house or rustic arbor at some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
distance from the house, where there were not
likely to be any listeners to their speech.</p>

<p>When they were seated Hugo asked abruptly,
"What did you do with Julian's boy?"</p>

<p>Fitzgerald started in some surprise, and perhaps
embarrassment, and answered, "You know very
well, Mr. Hugo. He died of scarlet fever."</p>

<p>"So you reported, and I was quite ready to
accept the report without inquiring into particulars.
Now I have reason to doubt your statement."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, he may have died of something
else," said Fitzgerald, shrugging his shoulders.
"As long as he died, I suppose it didn't matter to
you what was the nature of his disease?"</p>

<p>"Not if he were really dead."</p>

<p>"You don't doubt that, do you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do; moreover, I am quite convinced
that it is false."</p>

<p>"Then you had better keep it to yourself," suggested
Fitzgerald with a cunning smile, "since
the boy, if alive, would be his grandfather's
heir."</p>

<p>"But suppose his grandfather suspects he is
living?"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span></p>

<p>"That would alter matters. But why should
he suspect?"</p>

<p>"Fitzgerald, do you know where this boy is?"
asked Hugo, searchingly.</p>

<p>"I don't even know that he is living. If you
do you know more than I do about him."</p>

<p>"You know, at least, that he did not die at the
time you reported his death."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't mind confessing as much as that."</p>

<p>"<i>You played me false!</i>" said Hugo, with angry
bitterness.</p>

<p>"Suppose I did?" retorted Fitzgerald, defiantly.
"That's better than to kill an innocent boy, isn't
it?"</p>

<p>"Hush!" exclaimed Hugo, in alarm. "Don't
use such words. They might be overheard."</p>

<p>"How do you know the boy is alive?" asked
Fitzgerald, after a pause.</p>

<p>"I saw him myself within a week."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"At Crampton, in a circus performance; the
boy was riding bareback in the ring. He is called
on the bills, 'The Boy Wonder,' and is a daring
and graceful rider. Julian was always fond of
horses."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span></p>

<p>"What name does he bear?"</p>

<p>"Robert Rudd."</p>

<p>"Are you sure it is Julian's son?"</p>

<p>"As sure as I need be. He is the perfect image
of my cousin at his age."</p>

<p>"The boy has no suspicion of his origin, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Not the slightest."</p>

<p>"Then why need you be troubled?"</p>

<p>"Because my uncle was with me, and he, too,
noticed the extraordinary resemblance of the boy-rider
to his son. Ever since he has been restless,
and now he insists upon my seeking out the boy,
and bringing him here to live with him."</p>

<p>Fitzgerald whistled.</p>

<p>"That would make a dark lookout for you, Mr.
Hugo," he said.</p>

<p>"Of course it would. Besides, if the boy knew
anything of his past history, my uncle would be
readily convinced that it was really his grandson,
and I would be set aside as the heir to Chestnutwood."</p>

<p>"I see."</p>

<p>"Now tell me, Fitzgerald, how does it happen
that the boy has been trained up to such a career?"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span></p>

<p>"I can't tell positively. I gave a tramp a sum
of money to take charge of him and carry him
about, passing him off as his own son. I suppose
the man died and the boy fell in with some circus
people, who saw that they could make use of him."</p>

<p>"That seems plausible enough," said Hugo,
thoughtfully. "At any rate our concern is not
with the past, but with the future. I suppose you
are not exactly prosperous?"</p>

<p>Fitzgerald drew a purse from his pocket, and
extracted a twenty-five cent coin.</p>

<p>"That is all the money I have," he answered.</p>

<p>"Do you feel like going into my employment
again?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then we will see if between us we cannot
stave off this danger which threatens my prospects."</p>

<p>There was a lengthened conference, into the
particulars of which we need not enter, stating
only that Robert was the subject of it. Fitzgerald
left Chestnutwood that same evening, plentifully
supplied with money.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.<br />
<span class="small">THE CANVAS MAN.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="caps">C<span class="upper">arden</span>, the canvas man, though discharged
from the circus, did not leave town. He
hoped to be reinstated in his old position, and
made a personal appeal to the manager. But the
latter returned a decided negative.</p>

<p>"Don't I do my work well?" asked Carden.</p>

<p>"I have no fault to find with you on that score."</p>

<p>"Then why do you discharge me?"</p>

<p>"You know well enough."</p>

<p>"Is it because that boy Robert Rudd has lied
about me?"</p>

<p>"Robert Rudd would not lie about anybody.
I have perfect confidence in him. As for you,
Carden, you may as well make up your mind to
leave the town and seek employment elsewhere.
As long as I am manager of this circus I will
never again employ you in any capacity."</p>

<p>Carden's face grew dark and lowering. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
saw that the manager was in earnest, and he said
no more, but went away muttering something to
himself in a low voice which the manager could
not understand.</p>

<p>"That is a bad fellow!" thought Mr. Coleman.
"We are well rid of him. He looks as if he could
do something worse than steal."</p>

<p>Finding himself foiled in his attempt to regain
his old place, Carden felt still more incensed
against the boy, whom he considered to be the
cause of his dismissal. He felt that it would be a
satisfaction to injure him in some way, and so
revenge himself. For this purpose he determined
to remain in the town until the circus left. He
secured board, therefore, in the family of a farmer
not far away, and spent his days about the village
and his evenings in some low drinking place.</p>

<p>One day as he was sauntering along the street,
with a discontented scowl upon his face, he came
face to face with a well-dressed man, who appeared
to be a stranger in the place.</p>

<p>He would have passed him by without any
other notice than a passing glance, had not the
stranger accosted him.</p>

<p>"A pleasant day, my friend," he said, affably.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span></p>

<p>"Who said I was your friend?" returned
Carden, with a growl.</p>

<p>"I assumed it, since you have no reason to be
my enemy," said the other, not in the least put
out by the roughness with which his greeting was
received.</p>

<p>"I don't know you, and I don't want to," continued
Carden.</p>

<p>"Really, you are very frank," laughed the new
acquaintance. "A trifle rough, perhaps, but I
like sincerity. You are no hypocrite, my friend."</p>

<p>"I should like to hear anybody call me so," said
Carden, defiantly.</p>

<p>"I won't be the one at any rate. However, its
dry talking in the street. Suppose we go in here
(they were just passing a drinking saloon) and
drink to our better acquaintance."</p>

<p>He could have said nothing better calculated to
soften Carden's asperity.</p>

<p>"I believe you're a trump, after all," said the
canvas man, in a changed tone.</p>

<p>"I hope you'll find me so. Well, come in."</p>

<p>Carden readily followed him into the saloon,
and they sat down to a table with a bottle and
two glasses before them.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span></p>

<p>"Now, what's your game?" asked Carden, abruptly.</p>

<p>"My game?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I s'pose you wouldn't have stood treat
if you hadn't wanted something of me."</p>

<p>The stranger laughed.</p>

<p>"You are sharp," said he. "However, I don't
mind confessing that I am a stranger in the place
and wanted company and possibly a little information.
Do you know anything about the circus&mdash;Coleman's
circus&mdash;which I see is showing here?"</p>

<p>"I ought to. I belong to it."</p>

<p>"Oh, you are connected with it."</p>

<p>"No. I'm not now. I was."</p>

<p>"So, you left them."</p>

<p>"Left them," repeated Carden with an oath.
"I was kicked out."</p>

<p>"Indeed, my friend, I sympathize with you.
May I ask in what capacity you were employed?"</p>

<p>"I was a canvas man."</p>

<p>"Really, I don't want to meddle with what is
none of my business, but on what pretext were you
discharged?"</p>

<p>Carden hardly liked to admit that he was suspected
of theft, but his wrongs were recent and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
he took a bitter satisfaction in dwelling upon
them. So he overcame his reluctance by degrees.</p>

<p>"It was all on account of that young rascal
Robert Rudd," he said.</p>

<p>"Robert Rudd!" repeated the stranger, his face
indicating strong interest. "Who is he?"</p>

<p>"A bareback rider&mdash;a mere boy, whom I could
twist round my finger."</p>

<p>"But I don't see how he could get you discharged."</p>

<p>"Then I'll tell you. He went to Coleman and
told him that he found me trying to unlock his
closet and get at his property."</p>

<p>"Of course that was false?"</p>

<p>"Of course it was!" growled Carden. "But
the manager believed him, and bounced me."</p>

<p>"What could make the boy get up such a
story?"</p>

<p>"He hated me; he treated me like a dog, and
put on airs, just as if we wasn't in the same business.
He wouldn't drink with me when I asked
him."</p>

<p>"Then he is proud, is he?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but he hasn't anything to be proud of.
He thinks himself a gentleman, just because he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
can ride, and looks down on me as a poor canvas
man."</p>

<p>"He must be very disagreeable!"</p>

<p>"Of course he is, but the manager don't think
so. He treats him as if he was a prince."</p>

<p>"Do you know anything about this Robert
Rudd?" asked the stranger, thoughtfully. "Has
he got parents living?"</p>

<p>"Not as I know of."</p>

<p>"How long has he been with the circus?"</p>

<p>"He has been riding ever since he was a small
kid."</p>

<p>"Does he ride well?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, he'll do," said Carden, with faint
praise.</p>

<p>"I should think he would have been afraid to
provoke you&mdash;a strong, stout man like you," said
the stranger meditatively, surveying the strong
frame and muscular arms of the ex-canvas man.</p>

<p>"He'll repent it yet," flamed up Carden, his resentment
fired by these artful words. "I don't
mean to have any whipper-snapper like him get
the better of me."</p>

<p>"I can't say you are wrong, my friend, though
I know nothing of the matter further than you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
have told me. What are your plans? When
were you discharged?"</p>

<p>"Day before yesterday. Coleman told me to
leave town, but I shan't. I shall hang round here
till I see some way of gettin' even with that young
rascal."</p>

<p>"It does seem hard that you should have had
your means of living taken away from you through
the spite of a boy. He must have a very bad
disposition, this Robert Rudd."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Carden, in a voice which was becoming
thick through his frequent potations, for
he was drinking two glasses or more to the stranger's
one. "I'm a poor man, and it's hard to be
thrown out of work."</p>

<p>"I suppose you haven't saved up much money,
then?"</p>

<p>"Saved! What could I save out of fifteen
dollars a month?"</p>

<p>"That is poor pay, certainly. Is this boy,
Robert Rudd, well paid?"</p>

<p>"Well paid? He's got two hundred dollars
saved up."</p>

<p>"You don't tell me so! That is a good deal for
a boy. Where does he keep it?"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span></p>

<p>"In his locker," answered Carden, an expression
of cupidity sweeping over his face.</p>

<p>This was not unnoticed by the stranger, who
said to himself: "Unless I am greatly mistaken,
the boy was right in charging you with trying to
get at his hoard. I can read it in your face."</p>

<p>"You say he is a fine rider?" he said, changing
the subject.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; he's well enough."</p>

<p>"But if anything should startle the horse or
frighten him, anything unexpectedly, I mean, he
would be in some danger of being thrown off,
wouldn't he?"</p>

<p>"That's so!" said Carden, as if a sudden idea
had dawned upon his mind.</p>

<p>"It seems a dangerous business, this," said the
stranger, carelessly. "If, now, some malicious
person should throw something at the horse when
he was in the ring, it might prove dangerous to the
boy."</p>

<p>"So it would!" said Carden, eagerly.</p>

<p>"Well, my friend," said the stranger, rising,
"I see we've drained the bottle. Suppose we go
out again."</p>

<p>When they emerged into the street, Fitzgerald,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
for it was he, shook hands with the canvas man,
and said: "Well, I must go back to the hotel. I
hope to meet you again, my friend."</p>

<p>"I think I've set things in train," thought
Fitzgerald. "I will attend the circus this evening."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.<br />
<span class="small">AN ATHLETIC CONTEST.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="caps">T<span class="upper">he</span> two boy riders were taking their usual
afternoon walk, when they met Carden. The
canvas man frowned, but his face seemed also to
wear an expression of triumphant malice, as if he
could foresee some evil in store for Robert.</p>

<p>"Did you notice how Carden looked, Robert?"
asked Charlie.</p>

<p>"Not very pleasant. He hasn't forgotten me
for detecting him in his attempt to rob me."</p>

<p>"He looked as if he had heard of some bad luck
for you."</p>

<p>"That must be your imagination, Charlie. I've
had no bad luck."</p>

<p>"I wonder what makes Carden stay here now
he is discharged from the circus," said Charlie,
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"I suppose he can stay here as cheap as anywhere,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
said Robert. "I don't trouble myself
about him or his plans."</p>

<p>"He is your enemy, Rob. He may try to do
you some harm."</p>

<p>"I will be on my guard, but I won't worry myself
about it."</p>

<p>They came to an open field, where half a dozen
boys were engaged in athletic sports. There was
soon to be a picnic, and prizes had been offered
for the best running, leaping and vaulting, and
these boys were engaged in practising for the
grand contest.</p>

<p>"Let us stop and look at them," said Charlie.</p>

<p>"Very well," answered his friend.</p>

<p>So they took up a position about fifty feet away
and regarded the contestants with interest.</p>

<p>Their presence was noticed by the boys, who at
once recognized them as circus riders.</p>

<p>"Let us invite them to join us," said Frank
Perry, a boy of sixteen.</p>

<p>"Yes," chimed in several others.</p>

<p>"I object," said Ronald Percy, stiffly. "My
father wouldn't care to have me associate with
circus performers."</p>

<p>Ronald was the son of a rich manufacturer, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
was generally considered snobbish by his companions.
At any rate he presumed greatly upon
his "blue blood" and his father's wealth, and
attempted to be very exclusive. It certainly was
nothing to the discredit of his father that he had
worked his way up to his present position from
the position of a poor factory boy, but it might
have led Ronald to reflect upon the folly of his
personal pretensions. But his mother claimed to
be of "genteel" family, and had imbued the boy
with her own notions.</p>

<p>"What's the objection, if they are circus performers?"
asked Sidney Grey, who might really
have claimed aristocratic lineage if he had so desired.</p>

<p>"Do you consider circus performers fit company
for you?" asked Ronald, superciliously.</p>

<p>"Yes, if they behave themselves like gentlemen;
and these two look as well bred as we are."</p>

<p>"Of course they do," said Frank Perry. "Let
us have them here."</p>

<p>This seemed to be the general wish, and Ronald's
protest went for nothing.</p>

<p>Sidney Grey left the group of boys and walked
towards where Robert and Charlie were standing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
He was a slender boy with a frank, pleasant face
which prepossessed a stranger in his favor at first
sight.</p>

<p>"Won't you join us?" he asked. "We are practising
for the picnic next Saturday. There are to
be some prizes offered for running, vaulting, and
so on."</p>

<p>"Thank you," answered Robert. "I will join
you with pleasure."</p>

<p>"So will I," said Charlie, "but I am afraid I
might beat you all in jumping."</p>

<p>"We will take the risk," said Sydney, smiling.</p>

<p>"We are just going to have some leaping, and
will give you a chance. Perhaps it is lucky you
won't be at the picnic."</p>

<p>Sidney returned to his friends, followed by the
two circus boys.</p>

<p>The trial about to commence was a standing
jump. The two rivals for superiority were Sidney
and Ronald. They were of about the same
size, and seemed, so far as appearance went, very
well matched. Probably there was nothing, save
his family and position, of which Ronald was
more proud than of his jumping, and he looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
forward complacently to the trial which was now
about to take place.</p>

<p>"Will you try first?" asked Sidney of Robert.</p>

<p>"No, thank you; I will wait to the end."</p>

<p>"Won't you?" he next asked of Charlie Davis.</p>

<p>"I don't mind," answered Charlie, readily.</p>

<p>Charlie was small of his age, and was not likely
to be a very formidable competitor. He made a
jump which proved to be a little less than five
feet, and was not bad for a boy of his size who
was not accustomed to this kind of exercise.</p>

<p>"There, boys, beat that if you can," he said,
of course in fun.</p>

<p>The boys smiled and the trial continued.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to chronicle each jump. Sidney
Grey came up at last and jumped six feet
and three inches.</p>

<p>"Very well, Sidney," said one of his friends.
"I don't believe that will be beat."</p>

<p>"I do," said Ronald, emphatically. "I haven't
tried yet."</p>

<p>"Take your turn, then," said Sidney, good-naturedly.
"I shouldn't be surprised if you beat
me."</p>

<p>Ronald appeared to be of the same opinion, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
it turned out that his expectations were fulfilled.
He gathered himself up for a tremendous effort,
and cleared six feet four inches.</p>

<p>"Good!" said Sidney, not disturbed by his
rival's success. "If you jump like this next Saturday
you will carry off the prize."</p>

<p>"I've beat you all," said Ronald, triumphantly.</p>

<p>"Not quite all," said Sidney. "There's one
here who hasn't jumped yet," pointing to Robert.</p>

<p>"Oh well, he can try if he wants to," said Ronald,
superciliously, looking as if he thought it didn't
matter much whether he did or not.</p>

<p>"Your name is Robert, isn't it?" said Sidney.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then, Robert, you will have the honor of closing
this contest."</p>

<p>Under ordinary circumstances Robert would
not have cared to win, but he had chanced to
overhear Ronald's objections to associating with
circus performers, and had noticed the airs of superiority
which he assumed, and he thought he
would like to take down his pride a little. His
training had given him unusual strength and elasticity
of limb, and he was better prepared than any
of the other boys to excel in a contest of this kind.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span></p>

<p>He took the position which had been marked as
the starting point, and standing for a moment
motionless, made a sudden spring forward, and
the result was regarded with admiring astonishment.</p>

<p>"Six feet and eight inches!" declared Sidney,
after measuring. "You are the champion, Robert.
None of us can come up with you."</p>

<p>The face of Ronald was an interesting study.
He was astonished and mortified. He couldn't
bear to have his record surpassed.</p>

<p>"It wan't a fair leap," he said with chagrin.
"He stood too far forward."</p>

<p>"No, he didn't," answered, Sidney; "I noticed
how he stood myself."</p>

<p>"If you like, I will jump again," said Robert
quietly, turning to Ronald.</p>

<p>"That will be fairer," said Ronald, hoping Robert
would the second time fall short of his own
mark.</p>

<p>Again Robert took his place, and would not
jump till Ronald himself had declared that he
was in the right place. Then, making an extra
effort, he cleared six feet and nine inches.</p>

<p>"You didn't make much by your doubting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
Ronald," said Frank Perry. "Are you satisfied
now?"</p>

<p>"I didn't bargain to jump against a circus boy,"
said Ronald, sullenly.</p>

<p>"That won't affect your chances at the picnic,"
said Sidney. "Robert won't be there."</p>

<p>"Nor I," said Charlie Davis.</p>

<p>"We are not much afraid of you, Charlie," said
Sidney, smiling.</p>

<p>"Oh, I didn't half try!" said Charlie.</p>

<p>"It's lucky for us you didn't," said Sidney.</p>

<p>Ronald walked off in disgust, but Robert and
Charlie remained with their new friends, whom
they found pleasant and companionable. That
was the last of the contests, but a game of ball
was got up, in which the two circus boys joined.</p>

<p>When they were ready to part Sidney said, in a
friendly way, "I am glad to have made your acquaintance.
Come and see me to-morrow afternoon
if you feel like it. I should like to ask you
something of your life and adventures, for I suppose
you have had adventures."</p>

<p>"Thank you; I will come," answered Robert.</p>

<p>But circumstances arose which prevented his
keeping his engagement.</p>

<span class="small">THE CANVAS MAN FINDS A BONANZA.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="caps">F<span class="upper">itzgerald</span> had put a new idea into the
head of the canvas man&mdash;an idea which the
man's unscrupulous and cruel nature readily welcomed
and adopted. It was with malicious satisfaction
that he thought it over, and considered how
he should carry it out.</p>

<p>There was, however one circumstance that interfered
with his cheerfulness&mdash;the want of money.
He had never been a saving man, and now that he
was discharged, and without an income, his fortunes
were at a low ebb. He foresaw that after
carrying out his purpose it would be necessary for
him to leave Crampton, but as his purse contained
but seventy-five cents it did not seem possible to
go far unless he walked.</p>

<p>"If I had only got that boy's $200, I should be
all right," he said to himself. "It would have
been better for him and for me, too, for in that
case I wouldn't do him any harm."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span></p>

<p>Carden had no friends of whom he could ask a
loan with any hope of success&mdash;in fact, it is doubtful
whether he had any friends at all. While in
this perplexity he chanced to recall a conversation
he had heard some days before in a billiard saloon.
It ran thus:</p>

<p>"Yes, Tarbox has more money than any farmer
in town. He is mean and close-fisted, and so
spends next to nothing. Of course when that is
kept up year after year a man can't help getting
rich."</p>

<p>"Where does he invest his money&mdash;in savings
banks?"</p>

<p>"No, he is afraid of them. He is of a suspicious
nature, and I shouldn't wonder if he follows the
example of an old uncle of his who died twenty
years ago."</p>

<p>"How is that?"</p>

<p>"Why, the old man lived in a miserable way in
a poor hut, and after he died it was found that
he had secreted large sums in various places in and
about the hut. I don't know how many thousand
dollars."</p>

<p>"Did Nathan Tarbox inherit any of his uncle's
money?"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, he came in for a third of it."</p>

<p>"You think he hides his money in the same
way?"</p>

<p>"I think it very probable. Of course it is very
silly, for he gets no interest, and he is really in
more danger of losing it than if it were earning
dividends of interest in some good bank. However,
that's the man's nature."</p>

<p>In his necessity Carden recalled this conversation,
and, having no conscientious scruples, he
pondered how he should turn it to account.</p>

<p>"If I could find one of the farmer's hiding-places
for his money," he thought, "I might
make a good thing out of it. The money isn't
doing him any good. I might as well have it."</p>

<p>He mechanically took his way towards the Tarbox
farm, impelled by a faint hope that he might
hear or see something to his advantage.</p>

<p>Now it chanced that at some distance from the
farm-house was an old barn, which had been built
by the farmer's father, and which was still used,
though a newer one had been built nearer the
house.</p>

<p>From the street, towards the close of the afternoon,
Carden saw Mr. Tarbox taking his way towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
this old barn, and out of curiosity he jumped
over the stone wall and followed him.</p>

<p>"I wonder if it would do any good to ask him to
lend me five dollars?" thought the canvas man.
"I might tell him I had been discharged through
the influence of Anak and the boy, and he has
reason to hate both. At any rate it won't do any
harm to try. So I'll follow him cautiously, and
see if I can accomplish anything."</p>

<p>Mr. Tarbox did not perceive that he was followed.
He went by a well-worn path to the old
barn, and, opening a small door at the side, went
in.</p>

<p>Carden came up presently and peered in through
a crack of the door. The crack was narrow, but
still wide enough to enable him to see what was
going on within.</p>

<p>Carden was actuated at first by mere curiosity,
but his curiosity speedily gave place to deep interest
when he saw Tarbox lift a trap door and
prepare to descend into the barn cellar.</p>

<p>"What is he going to do, I wonder?" thought
the canvas man.</p>

<p>He was disappointed to find that the farmer
and his operations were concealed from him, as,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
though he could see the trap door, he could not look
down into the cellar. Of course it was possible to
enter the barn and look down, but this would be
too venturesome, and, if he were observed it would
be hard to explain his curiosity in any satisfactory
manner.</p>

<p>However, it occurred to the eager looker-on
that it might be possible for him to look down
into the barn cellar through some crevice near
the bottom of the barn. No sooner had the idea
come into his mind than he discovered exactly
such an opening as he desired. He lost no time
in throwing himself flat upon the ground, and
putting his eye to a round hole&mdash;once a knot
hole.</p>

<p>Now his curiosity was gratified. Through this
loop-hole he saw the farmer with a small spade in
his hand, which he appeared to keep permanently
under the barn, digging at a particular spot in
the northeast corner, only a few feet from the ladder
beneath the trap-door.</p>

<p>Carden's heart beat high at this sight. It naturally
recalled to him the conversation he had heard
in the billiard saloon, and putting the two together
he jumped to the conclusion that Tarbox had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
come to this out-of-the-way spot to visit one of his
hoards&mdash;perhaps to add to it.</p>

<p>"If it should be so," he muttered to himself,
"then I am in luck. It won't be my fault if I
don't borrow a good sum without the farmer
knowing anything about it. Let me see what he
is doing."</p>

<p>He glued his eyes persistently to the loop-hole,
and watched with an anxious eagerness which can
be surmised the movements of the miserly farmer.</p>

<p>Tarbox did not need to dig long. Presently he
threw aside his spade, and getting on his knees
began to fumble with his hands in the cavity he
had made.</p>

<p>He drew up a round wooden box, such as housewives
often use to keep saleratus or other supplies
in, about the size of a market box of strawberries.
Probably it was one he had taken from
the pantry without his wife's observation, for Tarbox
was a man who could keep a secret from his
wife, at any rate when it related to money.</p>

<p>When Carden saw this box produced his suspicions
were increased almost to certainties, and
he waited with breathless anxiety till Tarbox
should open it.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span></p>

<p>This the farmer did not long delay doing, and
the unseen witness was rewarded for his watching
in seeing that the box was more than half full
of silver and gold. The silver preponderated, but
a few gold coins were mixed with them.</p>

<p>Carden felt like a hungry man favored with the
sight of a rich repast, and his eyes glittered with
cupidity. He would like to have made his way at
once to the cellar, throttled the farmer and seized
the box, but that would have been very imprudent.
Tarbox was a powerful man, and he would
have fought desperately for the money that was
so dear to him. Besides, even had Carden secured
the box, he could have hardly got away in the
afternoon without being observed. No, he must
curb his impatience, and defer his visit to a more
seasonable time.</p>

<p>"I can do it to-night," he muttered to himself,
"after the performance is over. Then I will get
out of town as soon as I can. I wonder how
much money there is there."</p>

<p>This was a fruitful and pleasing subject of contemplation,
and occupied his thoughts as he hurriedly
left the barn and made his way to the high
road.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span></p>

<p>He went to his boarding-place, made his small
possessions in the way of clothing into a bundle,
and regarded it with satisfaction.</p>

<p>"To-night I will leave Crampton forever," he
said. "After all, I shall be in fair luck, even if
I did get kicked out from the circus."</p>

<p>There was one thing, however, that he did not
take into the account. He had acted as a spy
upon the unsuspecting farmer, and so became the
possessor of a valuable secret. It didn't occur to
him that possibly he in turn might have attracted
observation, and that his movements might have
been watched.</p>

<p>It chanced that Charlie Davis was strolling out
alone, and had seen Carden enter Mr. Tarbox's
field and make his way to the barn.</p>

<p>"What can Carden be going there for?"
thought Charlie. "I'll watch him."</p>

<p>Charlie had also seen Mr. Tarbox, and he was
not slow in concluding that Carden, for some
reason which he could not at once guess, was
watching him.</p>

<p>"What in the world can Carden be looking at?"
he thought. "There can't be anything to steal in
that old barn. At any rate he's up to some mischief,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
I'll bet a hat. I'll tell&mdash;let me see&mdash;I'll tell
Anak, and ask what he thinks about it."</p>

<p>It was 6 o'clock when Charlie returned to the
circus tent, and he broached the subject at once to
the Norwegian giant.</p>

<p>Anak was a shrewd fellow, and he guessed the
truth.</p>

<p>"There's something valuable there on which
Carden has some designs, but he isn't likely to do
anything till late to-night. Meet me after the
performance, and we'll take a stroll over that
way."</p>

Crampton. Of course, though it was a large
town, it was not large enough to warrant the show
in staying so long, but for the large number of
visitors who were attracted from neighboring
towns. Both by rail and by carriages of all sorts,
from farmers' wagons to top buggies and carryalls,
hundreds of people flocked to see the wonders it
contained. Many a young heart was stirred with
ambition to pursue the noble profession of circus
performers, considering that the circus clown was
as illustrious a personage, not perhaps as the
President of the United States, but at least as a
member of the Cabinet, or a Congressman. The
time would come of course when these admiring
youngsters would learn that the halo which invested
the circus performer was unreal, but, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
the time being, any one connected with the circus
was a great, illustrious and envied personage.</p>

<p>One day Robert Rudd and Charlie Davis were
standing outside the tent, near the lemonade stand,
when a boy of sixteen or seventeen, clad in rustic
attire and "with hayseed in his hair," approached
them, and, though evidently somewhat awed by
the idea that he was standing in the presence of
two circus performers, ventured to ask:</p>

<p>"Do you two belong to the circus?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Robert.</p>

<p>"You bet we do," said Charlie, vivaciously.
"The circus would have to shut up shop but for
us."</p>

<p>Robert smiled, but the visitor didn't. He was
too much in earnest.</p>

<p>"I seen you ridin' last evenin'," he said, next.</p>

<p>"Then you were at the performance?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I told dad I wanted to go, and he let me
have the money I earned weedin' corn, tho' he
said I better keep it to buy somethin' useful."</p>

<p>"I hope you enjoyed the evening," said Robert,
courteously.</p>

<p>"It was splendid! I don't see how you fellows
can ride so."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span></p>

<p>"It's all in the training."</p>

<p>"How long have you been a circus actor?" asked
the young rustic.</p>

<p>"Five or six years; I began when I was very
small."</p>

<p>"I began as soon as I could walk," said Charlie,
who liked to romance a little when he had an
opportunity.</p>

<p>"You don't say so?"</p>

<p>"Fact!" asserted Charlie.</p>

<p>"Did you ride on a hoss then?"</p>

<p>"No, I rode on a Newfoundland dog. When
I got older I tried a pony. Now Rob and I are
the champion boy-riders of Europe and America."</p>

<p>"Speak for yourself, Charlie," said Robert,
smiling. "I don't make any such claims."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, don't be discouraged. You'll ride as
well as I do some time."</p>

<p>"You flatter me," said Robert.</p>

<p>"I say, do you think there's any chance for me
to learn the business?" asked the country boy,
lowering his voice, in an anxious tone.</p>

<p>"What line do you want to take up?" asked
Robert.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span></p>

<p>"Is there any line?" asked the boy, not understanding.</p>

<p>"I mean, do you want to be a rider, a clown,
an acrobat, or what?"</p>

<p>"I'd like to ride like you two."</p>

<p>"I am afraid you are rather large to begin,"
said Robert, surveying the boy's large hands and
feet, and his height, at least three inches greater
than his own.</p>

<p>"Am I too big?" asked the boy, disappointed.</p>

<p>"No, you're not," said Charlie. "Why, I
could teach you myself."</p>

<p>"I wish you would. I'd like goin' round with
a circus better than working for dad on the farm.
Do you fellow's get paid big wages?"</p>

<p>"Of course we do," answered Charlie. "I get
fifty dollars a week, board and travelling expenses."</p>

<p>"Fifty dollars a week!" gasped the country
boy, expanding his eyes in astonishment.</p>

<p>"Yes, you see we're first-class performers."</p>

<p>"I couldn't get but a dollar and a half a week
and board workin' on a farm," answered the country
boy.</p>

<p>"What's your name?" asked Charlie, abruptly.</p>

<p>"Jotham Sprague."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span></p>

<p>"That wouldn't do for the stage; you'd have to
take a better name."</p>

<p>"I'd take any name; fact is, I don't like Jotham
myself."</p>

<p>"It isn't romantic enough," said Charlie. "The
manager wouldn't have anybody of that name.
It sounds too countrified."</p>

<p>"What sort of a name would do?" asked the
boy.</p>

<p>"Lorenzo Leon would do pretty well."</p>

<p>"That's splendid!" said Jotham, admiringly.</p>

<p>"You see, it would look well on the bills. The
famous bareback rider. Lorenzo Leon, who has
just been imported from his native Italy at large
expense, will perform some of his wonderful feats
in the ring."</p>

<p>"I'd like that first rate," said Jotham, "only I
ain't from Italy."</p>

<p>"No matter; no one will know that. Now, if
you want to come in and take a lesson I'll give
you one."</p>

<p>"How much will you charge?" asked Jotham,
eager but cautious.</p>

<p>"Oh, I won't charge you anything. I'll do it
out of friendship. Come in, Rob."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span></p>

<p>"No, Charlie, not just now."</p>

<p>Robert suspected that Charlie meditated a practical
joke, and did not care to take part in it.</p>

<p>They entered the tent&mdash;it was in the middle of
the forenoon&mdash;and Charlie went to his friend the
clown, and whispered a few words.</p>

<p>"So the young gentleman wants to take a lesson
in riding, does he?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Jotham, eagerly, "if you
have no objection."</p>

<p>"We'll do it for you as a favor," said the clown.
"What's your name, young man?"</p>

<p>Jotham was about to answer correctly, when
Charlie broke in&mdash;"His name is Lorenzo Leon,
from Italy."</p>

<p>The clown grinned.</p>

<p>"A very fine name!" he answered. "Bring
out the Andalusian steed."</p>

<p>An attendant led out the trick mule, which,
meekly enough, walked round the ring.</p>

<p>"Can you ride that?" asked the clown.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I can ride a bigger hoss than that."</p>

<p>"Mount, then, and away!"</p>

<p>Charlie held the mule, which stood very quiet
and demure, while the boy was getting on. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
no sooner was the boy on his back than he lifted
his ears and dashed round the ring in such a
lively way, making sudden turns and curves, that
Jotham was soon clinging to him as pale as a
sheet, with his arms closely clasped about the
mule's neck, in momentary expectation of being
thrown off. At this most critical point the clown
shouted, "Now get up and stand on his back!"</p>

<p>Instead of doing this Jotham roared, "Stop
him; take me off," in an extremity of terror.</p>

<p>At a signal the mule threw up his hind legs and
the rider measured his length, more frightened
than hurt, on the sawdust.</p>

<p>As he picked himself up Charlie came up to
him.</p>

<p>"Have another lesson, Lorenzo!"</p>

<p>"I guess I'll go back to farmin'," answered
Jotham, picking himself up and finding to his
relief that none of his limbs were broken.</p>

<p>"Oh, nonsense! Try it again!"</p>

<p>"No, I guess not; I never would make a rider,"
and the boy left the tent completely cured of his
wish to be a rider. He had received a rough but
a wholesome lesson.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span></p>

<p>In the evening the performance began at the
usual time. There was no change in the bill, and
everything was expected to go on as usual.</p>

<p>In due time Robert came out for his equestrian
act. In the course of it he had to jump through
a hoop and over a banner. While he was doing
this, suddenly a stone, as large as a base ball, hurled
from the spectators' seats, struck the horse, and he
swerved. The result was that Robert, instead of
lighting on his back, fell to the ground in such a
way that he turned his ankle, while the horse
dashed by.</p>

<p>He was picked up, his face pale with the pain
in his ankle, and was helped from the ring by
some of the attendants.</p>

<p>"Shame! Shame! Lynch him!" rose from fifty
indignant spectators. "Where's the man that
threw the stone?"</p>

<p>But no one knew, except one. In one of the
rear seats sat Carden, the discharged canvas man,
smiling with malignant triumph at the mischief
he had done.</p>

<p>"I said I'd be even with him," he muttered.
"I hope he's badly hurt."</p>

<p>Among the spectators were Sidney Grey and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
his father, Dr. Grey, a skilful physician. Both
hurried to the ring.</p>

<p>"Are you much hurt, Robert?" asked Sidney,
anxiously.</p>

<p>"I am in considerable pain, but I don't think
I am seriously hurt," said Robert, attempting to
smile.</p>

<p>"I will take the boy to my house," said Dr.
Grey to the manager. "I am a physician, and I
will see that he receives every attention."</p>

<p>"Thank you, doctor, I accept your offer gratefully,"
said Mr. Coleman. "I am attached to the
boy, and I will bear all his expenses."</p>

<p>"There will be none, while he is at my house,"
said the doctor. "My son has taken a liking to
young Rudd, and he will be a welcome guest."</p>

<p>When the performance was over, Carden left
the tent stealthily. He had work to do that night.
He bent his steps towards the house of Mr. Tarbox.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX.<br />
<span class="small">THE AMATEUR DETECTIVES.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="caps">W<span class="upper">hen</span> it was found that Robert was not seriously
hurt there was a general feeling of
relief among his circus friends, for the boy rider
was a great favorite. Though he was somewhat
reserved he was always polite, affable, and ready
to be of assistance to any of his associates. He
was sometimes called "the little gentleman," and
was generally supposed to have sprung from a
good family, though even to himself his birth was
a secret.</p>

<p>Among those who inquired anxiously for him
were Charlie Davis and the Norwegian giant.</p>

<p>"He has sprained his ankle slightly," said Dr.
Grey. "It will require a week or two of perfect
rest, perhaps more. Indeed it will not do for him
to ride again this season."</p>

<p>"Are you sure of that, doctor?" asked the
manager.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span></p>

<p>"I am positive that it would be most imprudent."</p>

<p>"I asked because it cuts off the boy from earning
money."</p>

<p>"There need be no trouble on that score. He
can stay at my house as long as he likes, and it
will cost him nothing."</p>

<p>"You are very kind, Dr. Grey. However, the
boy is not without funds. I have two hundred
dollars of his in my possession, and before I leave
town I will hand it to him or you, as this accident
will part us for the remainder of the season."</p>

<p>"Give it to him, then. I am glad he has been
so provident."</p>

<p>Dr. Grey and Sidney obtained a carriage, and
Robert was taken home to the doctor's comfortable
and even luxurious dwelling, for, besides
having had an extensive practice for years, he had
married a lady with a fortune. Leaving Robert
there in good hands, we return to the circus.</p>

<p>As soon as the entertainment was over, Charlie
and Anak, remembering their engagement, bent
their steps towards the house of Mr. Tarbox.
They were detained, however, for fifteen minutes
or more before being able to depart, and this gave
Carden an opportunity to get at work.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span></p>

<p>"Have you seen Carden this evening, Charlie?"
asked Anak.</p>

<p>"Yes; he was at the circus."</p>

<p>"I wonder whether it was he that threw the
rock?" said Anak, suddenly.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't wonder. I didn't think of it
before."</p>

<p>"He could have no other object in coming to
the show. He had seen it plenty of times. Besides,
his money must have been low."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he got in for nothing," suggested
Charlie.</p>

<p>"Go and ask."</p>

<p>Charlie, upon inquiring at the ticket-office,
found that Carden had tried to obtain a pass on
the score of his former connection with the circus,
but without success, as the manager had left orders
that he was not to be admitted, except on the same
footing with others.</p>

<p>"He grumbled some, but finally bought a
ticket," added the ticket-seller. "I wondered at
it, for there was nothing new to him."</p>

<p>"He must have been the one who fired the rock
at poor Robert's horse&mdash;the villain!" said Anak,
gravely. "We know he had a spite against the boy."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span></p>

<p>"I'd like to fire a rock at him!" said Charlie,
impetuously.</p>

<p>"He may get into trouble yet," said Anak.
"Let us go along."</p>

<p>"Shall we go to the house and speak to Mr. Tarbox?"
asked Charlie.</p>

<p>"Yes, for he will know where to look for him."</p>

<p>"I wonder what he will say when he sees you?
Bet he'll be scared."</p>

<p>"We'll soon let him understand that we came
for his good."</p>

<p>Mr. Tarbox was just about retiring, or rather he
was making the usual preparations&mdash;bringing in
kindling wood from the shed, raking out the fire,
etc.&mdash;when a knock was heard at the outer door.</p>

<p>In the Tarbox household such a thing as a visitor
at half-past 10 o'clock in the evening was absolutely
unknown.</p>

<p>"Who can it be, Nathan?" asked Mrs. Tarbox,
in a flutter.</p>

<p>"How do I know?" returned her husband in
the usual polite tone in which he was accustomed
to address his wife.</p>

<p>"Suppose it should be burglars?" suggested
Mrs. Tarbox, nervously.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span></p>

<p>"They'd be very likely to knock at the door,
wouldn't they, you goose!" said her husband.
"That's exactly what they always do, isn't it?"</p>

<p>The knock was repeated.</p>

<p>"Go to the door, Mrs. Tarbox."</p>

<p>"Oh mercy, Nathan, I couldn't. I might be
killed."</p>

<p>"Give me the lamp, then, you fool!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Tarbox readily gave her husband the lamp,
and he strode to the door.</p>

<p>When he opened it, and his inquiring glance
fell on the towering form of Anak, it must be admitted
that Mr. Tarbox himself felt nervous. He
made a movement to close the door, but Anak
thrust in his huge foot, and this made the effort
impossible.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" demanded Tarbox, his
calmness not quite undisturbed.</p>

<p>"We come on important business," said Anak,
in his deep voice.</p>

<p>"Then you might have come at a better time,"
said Tarbox, his fears dissipated and his ill-temper
returning. "It is time all honest persons were
abed."</p>

<p>"So it is, Mr. Tarbox," answered Anak, "but I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
am afraid there is one dishonest person that is
wide awake."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" demanded Tarbox, with
a vague suspicion that the remark might be made
at his expense.</p>

<p>"Is there anything of value concealed under the
barn yonder?" asked Anak, pointing to the one
already referred to in a former chapter.</p>

<p>"Why do you ask?" queried the farmer, turning
pale, and eying the questioner with suspicion.</p>

<p>"Because a man who has been discharged from
our show&mdash;a canvas man, named Carden&mdash;was
seen by Charlie here prowling about the barn
this afternoon, and trying to look under it through
a crack."</p>

<p>Now Tarbox turned pale in earnest.</p>

<p>"It must have been when I was there," he said.</p>

<p>"Very likely; were you under it?"</p>

<p>"Ye-es," answered the farmer.</p>

<p>"Then he was watching you. You know best
whether he was likely to see anything that could
be of service to him."</p>

<p>"Is he there now?" asked Tarbox, agitated.</p>

<p>"I should not be at all surprised."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span></p>

<p>"He may be robbing me at this moment," said
Tarbox, wildly.</p>

<p>"Then there is something hidden under the
barn?"</p>

<p>"Ye-es. What shall I do? Is he armed? Is
he a strong man?"</p>

<p>"No matter whether he is or not. I'm middling
strong myself," said the giant, with a laugh.
"Get your hat, and I'll go with you, and we'll see
if we can't defeat him and his plans."</p>

<p>"I'll go, too," added Charlie, in an important
tone.</p>

<p>"You alone are able to frighten him, Charlie,"
said Anak, aroused.</p>

<p>Tarbox got his hat and led the way hurriedly
towards the barn. Before they reached there a
sudden suspicion entered his mind and he stopped
short.</p>

<p>"How do I know but this is a trick?" he said,
nervously. "You may be intending to rob me
yourself."</p>

<p>"Make your mind easy, Mr. Tarbox!" said
Anak. "We don't do business in that way."</p>

<p>"You are my enemy," said Tarbox.</p>

<p>"Not at all. You have done me no harm. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
were meaning to arrest me, to be sure, but you
didn't, and I have no hard feelings against you.
I will do you a good turn if you will let me,
especially as this Carden is a bad fellow. He
tried to kill Robert Rudd, to-night."</p>

<p>"What, the boy rider?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Robert caught him stealing, or trying
to steal, from his locker, and this led to his discharge.
He threw a rock at the boy's horse, and
he was thrown."</p>

<p>At another time Tarbox might possibly have
felt rejoiced that the boy against whom he himself
felt a spite had met with an accident, but now
he felt too anxious about his own property to concern
himself about other matters.</p>

<p>By this time they had reached the solitary
barn.</p>

<p>Charlie got down on his knees and peered
through the same crevice which Carden had used
in the afternoon.</p>

<p>"He's there!" he exclaimed in excitement,
"and he's got a lighted candle."</p>

<p>"What is he doing?" asked Tarbox in agitation.</p>

<p>"He's digging."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span></p>

<p>"He will steal my money!" ejaculated Tarbox
in dismay. "There's between three and four
hundred dollars hidden there."</p>

<p>"Rather a queer savings bank, Mr. Tarbox!"
said Anak, dryly.</p>




<hr />

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XXI.<br />
<span class="small">CATCHING A BURGLAR.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="caps">C<span class="upper">arden</span> had not the least suspicion that he
was observed. The Tarbox farm-house stood
rather aloof from the village, and the barn, as we
have already stated, was at some distance from the
house. He worked away calmly, feeling that there
was no danger of his being interfered with.</p>

<p>At last he reached the box, and stooping lifted
it complacently.</p>

<p>Mr. Tarbox became very much agitated when
he saw his hoard in the possession of the burglar.</p>

<p>"Can't we get at him?" he asked of Anak in an
agitated whisper.</p>

<p>"No," whispered Anak. "Our best plan is
to wait for him, and seize him as he leaves the
barn."</p>

<p>"But he will have my money."</p>

<p>"Of course he will. We will catch him with
the stolen property in his possession."</p>

<p>"But it isn't safe for him to have it."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span></p>

<p>"It won't be safe for him, I'm thinking," said
Anak, dryly. "Don't you see if we reveal ourselves
now he will blow out the candle and remain
where he is, and we can't catch him in the dark.
Ten to one he'll get off with the money."</p>

<p>Tarbox saw that the giant was right. In spite
of his agitation, he couldn't help remarking that
Anak spoke English with remarkable ease&mdash;for a
Norwegian, and he said so.</p>

<p>Anak laughed.</p>

<p>"Oh well," he said, "it's a good while since I
was in Norway."</p>

<p>"Don't speak so loud, you two," said Charlie
Davis, whose eye was glued to the crevice. "He'll
hear you."</p>

<p>"The boy is right," said Anak.</p>

<p>"Is he coming this way yet?" asked Tarbox,
eagerly.</p>

<p>"Not yet; he is sitting down, counting the
money."</p>

<p>Tarbox groaned.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I'd like to choke him&mdash;the thief!" he muttered.</p>

<p>"Can't you find a better savings bank, friend
Tarbox?" said Anak.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm afraid of savings banks. They break
sometimes," answered the farmer.</p>

<p>"At any rate the money would be safer there
than here, and you would get interest for it besides.
But for us, or rather for Charlie here,
who watched that rascal this afternoon, you'd
have had to bid a long good-by to your money."</p>

<p>"He's got through counting it," said Charlie,
who was still watching, "and he's putting it in
his pocket."</p>

<p>"I shall never see it again!" murmured Tarbox,
sadly.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes you will&mdash;we've got the man as secure
as a rat in a rat-trap. He'll have to come out this
way, won't he?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he'll have to come up through the trap-door."</p>

<p>"If he hadn't the money, it would be well to
fasten down the trap-door, and keep him locked
up there for the night. As it is, we shall have to
secure him, and carry him to the station-house
ourselves."</p>

<p>"We might put him back under the barn after
we've taken the money from him," suggested
Charlie Davis.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span></p>

<p>"He may have matches with him," said Anak,
"and in that case he might set the barn on fire
out of revenge. He's an ugly customer, that Carden,
and is capable of anything."</p>

<p>"No, no, let him go!" said Tarbox, alarmed at
the suggestion of losing his barn by fire. "Take
the money from him and send him off."</p>

<p>"No, no; we won't let him off so easy," said
Anak. "There's another matter we must inquire
into. We must find out whether he is the man
that threw the rock at Robert's horse to-night. If
so, he must be punished for that."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, and this conversation took a much
briefer time than may be imagined, Carden had
ascended the ladder, emerged through the trap-door,
which he had left open when he went down,
and, with his ill-gotten booty stowed away in his
pockets, had reached the small door by which he
entered. He came out quite unconscious of danger,
when he felt a strong hand at his collar, and
his startled look fell upon the giant and his two
companions.</p>

<p>"What's all this?" he asked, in affected bravado.
"Let go of me, Anak."</p>

<p>"You villain!" exclaimed the farmer, furiously;
"give me back my money."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span></p>

<p>"Your money, old potato digger!" returned
Carden. "Who's got your money?"</p>

<p>"You have."</p>

<p>"It's a lie. How could I get hold of your
money?"</p>

<p>"What have you been doing in the barn?"
asked Anak.</p>

<p>"Lying down on the hay, if you must know,"
returned Carden. "I got turned out of my boarding-place
because I couldn't pay my board, and I
thought Old Turnip-Top here wouldn't mind my
getting a free bed lying on his hay."</p>

<p>"That's a lie," said Tarbox, in excitement;
"you've got my money in your pocket&mdash;three or
four hundred dollars."</p>

<p>"Where did I get hold of it? Do you keep
money in your barn?" sneered the canvas man.</p>

<p>"Carden, it's no use pretending ignorance; you
found out that our friend here had money concealed
under the barn floor&mdash;Charlie saw you spying
this afternoon&mdash;and you thought to-night
would be a good chance to secure it."</p>

<p>"So that boy blabbed about me, did he?" said
Carden, with an evil glance at Charlie. "He'd
best look out, or I'll serve him as I did&mdash;"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span></p>

<p>Here he stopped short; but Charlie finished his
sentence for him.</p>

<p>"As you did Rob to-night," he added; "that's
what you mean."</p>

<p>"I don't know what you mean," said the canvas
man, finding he had said too much.</p>

<p>"You know well enough!" said Anak, sternly,
for he liked Robert, and was incensed against the
man who had tried to do him such grievous
harm. "You know well enough what the boy
means; you were seen in the tent this evening,
and it was you who threw the rock at Robert
Rudd's horse."</p>

<p>"You can't prove it, and it's a lie!" said Carden,
defiantly.</p>

<p>"Make him give up the money," said the
farmer, impatiently, for he cared nothing for
Carden's attempt to injure our hero.</p>

<p>"I'll give it up if you'll let me go," said the
canvas man.</p>

<p>"You're not in a position to make terms," said
Anak. "We promise nothing."</p>

<p>"Then you won't get it," he returned, doggedly.</p>

<p>"We won't, eh?"</p>

<p>Anak, for he was the speaker, threw him down,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
and held his hands and feet as in a vise, while
Tarbox, at his invitation, thrust his hands into the
thief's pocket and drew out the gold and silver
coins by handfuls.</p>

<p>Carden ground his teeth, but he felt that resistance
was vain. He was a strong man, but Anak
had the strength of three ordinary men, and he
was disposed to exert his strength to the utmost
on this occasion, not only because he was opposed
to dishonesty, but because he had in his grasp the
man who had assaulted Robert.</p>

<p>"Have you got it all, Mr. Tarbox?" asked
Anak.</p>

<p>"Wait and I will count it," answered the farmer.</p>

<p>"Some of the money was mine," growled Carden.</p>

<p>"Was it? How much?"</p>

<p>"Ten dollars," answered the canvas man, after
a moment's thought.</p>

<p>"That's too thin, Carden, and doesn't tally with
your first story. You said you laid down on the
hay in the barn because you had no money and
were turned out of your boarding-house."</p>

<p>"Oh, you're too smart," muttered the baffled
thief.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span></p>

<p>"I think we shall prove too smart for you to-night.
Well, Mr. Tarbox, how about the money?"</p>

<p>"It's twenty-five cents short," said Tarbox, disturbed.</p>

<p>"Oh, well, if you have come as near it as that
you are lucky. Now let us be going."</p>

<p>"But I don't want to leave it here; some one
may find it."</p>

<p>"You would be ruined if you didn't find it,"
said Anak, contemptuously.</p>

<p>"Will you let me up now?" asked Carden.</p>

<p>"Yes, I will let you up, but I won't let you
go."</p>

<p>"Then I will lie here."</p>

<p>"If you can."</p>

<p>Despite his resistance Anak lifted him on his
shoulders and bore him off as easily as an ordinary
man would carry a boy three years old.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do with me?" asked
the canvas man.</p>

<p>"Deliver you over to the authorities," answered
Anak; and this he did, despite the alternate
prayers and menaces of his captive.</p>

<p>My young readers will be pleased to hear that
Carden passed the night in the station-house and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
was arraigned for trial the next day before the
court, which was then in session.</p>

<p>"I'm much obleeged to you," Tarbox had the
grace to say as they parted.</p>

<p>"And you won't have me arrested for trespass
and assault, Mr. Tarbox?" said Anak, laughing.</p>

<p>"No; you've done me a good service to-night."</p>

<p>"Take my advice and put your money in the
bank to-morrow," said Anak.</p>

<p>Tarbox did so; not only the money which had
so narrowly escaped being stolen, but his other
hoards were collected and carried to the nearest
savings bank, which was undoubtedly a wise act
on the part of the farmer.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII.<br />
<span class="small">ROBERT RUDD LEAVES THE CIRCUS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="caps">A <span class="upper">week</span> passed, and Robert Rudd was still the
guest of Dr. Grey. The circus had left town,
and so the boy-rider was separated from his professional
companions. Though he was not as
much attached to circus life as some, it was his
means of making a livelihood, and had been for
some years, and yielded him a considerably larger
income than a boy of his age was likely to earn in
any other way. Now, it imparts a pleasant feeling
of independence to earn one's living, and the
pleasure is heightened when not only a living is
earned, but there is a chance to lay up money besides.</p>

<p>When Robert was apprised of the approaching
departure of the circus he went to Dr. Grey.</p>

<p>"Dr. Grey," he said, "don't you think it will
be safe for me to go back to the circus?"</p>

<p>"Yes; it will be safe to go back to it, but not
to ride."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span></p>

<p>"How soon can I ride, do you think?"</p>

<p>"Your ankle will be weak for some time to
come; not too weak for ordinary exercise, but not
strong enough for bareback riding."</p>

<p>"In that case," said Robert, with some feeling
of disappointment, "there would be no advantage
in going back this season. I suppose I could ride
next season."</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly, if you desire it," said the doctor,
pointedly.</p>

<p>"Do you intend to travel with the circus when
you are a man?" asked Sidney.</p>

<p>"Not if I can find some other employment at
which I can make a fair living," answered Robert.
"I don t care much for it, but at present it pays
me better than anything else."</p>

<p>"That is not the most important consideration,
my lad," said the doctor.</p>

<p>"No; but at present I cannot afford to leave it."</p>

<p>"Why can't you stay with me all winter?" asked
Sidney, eagerly. "I should like your company
very much."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Sidney; you are a true friend."</p>

<p>"I second my boy's invitation," said the doctor,
cordially.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span></p>

<p>"Thank you, also," said Robert, gratefully. "I
feel your kindness the more because I have no
claims upon you."</p>

<p>"Then you will stay?" said Sidney, eagerly.</p>

<p>"What would Ronald Percy say if you adopted
me as a companion?" asked Robert, with a smile.</p>

<p>"I don't care what. I would ten times rather
have you for a friend than he."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Sidney. You are not prejudiced
against me because I am a circus boy."</p>

<p>"Why should I be? If you were rough and
coarse, I shouldn't fancy you, whether you were a
circus boy or not, but I consider you much more
of a gentleman than Ronald Percy," said Sidney,
warmly.</p>

<p>"I appreciate your good opinion, Sidney, but as
to remaining here all winter, though I should enjoy
it on many accounts, I would not like to be
dependent even upon so good friends while I am
able to earn my own living. If there were anything
your father had for me to do it would make
a difference."</p>

<p>"I must see if I can think of anything," said
Dr. Grey. "I am afraid I couldn't delegate any
of my medical duties to you. I fear my patients<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
would not repose confidence in so young a doctor."</p>

<p>So the circus kept on its way, and Robert remained
for a time at the house of the physician.
Those who know the characteristics of society in
a country village will not be surprised to learn
that the introduction of a circus boy into his
family led many to wonder at and criticise Dr.
Grey. Prominent among the critics was Ronald
Percy and his family.</p>

<p>"Really," said Mrs. Percy, a shallow woman,
who made large pretensions to fashion and position,
"I can't understand what Dr. Grey can be
thinking of, to admit a low circus boy into his
house. We don't know what associates the boy
has had in the past, but he must be coarse and ill-bred,
and surely he is not a fit companion for
Sidney Grey. I hope my Ronald won't get intimate
with him."</p>

<p>"You may be sure I won't, ma," said Ronald.
"I wouldn't demean myself by taking notice of
him. When Sidney wanted to invite him to join
in our games I opposed it."</p>

<p>"You, Ronald, can always be relied upon to
feel like a gentleman," said his mother, complacently.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
"Thank heaven! he hasn't any liking
for low company."</p>

<p>"I am told the boy is very gentlemanly," said
Mrs. Frost, a woman very different from Mrs.
Percy.</p>

<p>Mrs. Percy shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>"That is absurd, of course," she answered.
"Gentlemanly behavior isn't picked up in circuses.
I told the doctor so, but he is very eccentric,
and he wouldn't listen to anything against
his new favorite."</p>

<p>"That must be rather awkward for you, as Ronald
and Sidney are so much together."</p>

<p>"I have requested Ronald not to go to the doctor's
so much while that boy is staying there. I
feel that it is due to our position not to allow him
to form such intimacies."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, when Sidney Grey got up a little
party in honor of his guest, and invited Ronald
among others, the young aristocrat did not decline,
but presented himself promptly, notwithstanding
his mother's objection to the company of
the young circus rider.</p>

<p>Among the twenty boys and girls who assembled
in the drawing-room of Dr. Grey there was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
one more quiet in manner or gentlemanly in bearing
than Robert Rudd.</p>

<p>"I wonder where the boy has picked up his
high-bred manner?" thought the doctor. "It
must be natural to him."</p>

<p>This was the case. Robert had not been placed
in circumstances favorable to the formation of a
polished manner, but it was innate and instinctive.</p>

<p>At a pause during the evening Sidney said,
"Robert, can't you do something to entertain the
company?"</p>

<p>"Would you like to see a little juggling?" asked
Robert.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" cried several. Even Ronald Percy
looked interested. Still he could not help sneering
a little.</p>

<p>"Did you do that at the circus?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No," answered Robert, quietly. "I am not a
professional magician, but we had a professor of
magic with us at one time, who took the trouble
to show me a few simple tricks, and these I am
ready to perform at the request of Sidney."</p>

<p>"You couldn't please me or the company
better," said Sidney, eagerly.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span></p>

<p>"I shall have to ask you for a few articles,"
said Robert.</p>

<p>"Anything in the house is at your service,
Rob."</p>

<p>So for half an hour Robert amused the company
with a few tricks, which he did exceedingly well,
for it was a characteristic of our young hero to be
thorough in all he did. It is unnecessary to enumerate
his tricks, or to describe the interest which
the young company manifested. It is enough to
say that when he had finished he had established
himself in the good graces of every one present
except Ronald, who, though as much interested
as the rest, was unwilling to admit it.</p>

<p>"We are very much obliged to you, Robert,"
said Sidney, warmly. "You are a capital magician."</p>

<p>"I would advise you to go into that business,"
said Ronald, with his usual sneer. "I am told it
pays very well, and it isn't as low as the circus."</p>

<p>"I shall confine myself to performing for the
gratification of my friends," said Robert, coolly,
ignoring the impertinence of Ronald.</p>

<p>"Can't you do anything more for us, Robert?"
asked Sidney. "Do you sing?"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span></p>

<p>"A little," was the unexpected reply; "that is,
I can sing some of the popular melodies."</p>

<p>"Pray do."</p>

<p>"If any one will play the accompaniment."</p>

<p>A young girl was found to do this, and Robert
sang in a clear, musical voice several popular
favorites, which appeared to please no less than
his magical efforts.</p>

<p>"Really, Robert," said Mrs. Grey, "you are remarkably
well fitted to please a company of young
people. We are very much obliged to you."</p>

<p>"I am glad to have it in my power to do something
in return for your kindness, Mrs. Grey."</p>

<p>"The boy may belong to the circus," thought
Mrs. Grey, "but I should be glad if my son were
as accomplished, while I could not desire him to
be any more refined."</p>

<p>Ronald was secretly surprised, and not over well
pleased at Robert's popularity. He found himself
in a minority of one in his sneering attempts to
decry him.</p>

<p>At the end of a week, when Robert was beginning
to consider seriously what employment he
should follow in place of the one he had been
compelled to abandon, he received a letter through
the mail which equally surprised and pleased him.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.<br />
<span class="small">WHAT THE LETTER CONTAINED.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="caps">T<span class="upper">he</span> letter, which was directed in a bold hand to
Robert Rudd, care of Dr. Grey, ran thus:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>"<span class="smcap">Robert Rudd</span>: I understand that you have
left the circus on account of the accident you met
with recently, and I presume that you have not
yet found anything else to do. I chanced to be at
Crampton and saw you perform, and was favorably
impressed by your appearance. I am about to
make a journey to the West, and need the services
of a boy or young man to assist me in writing and
serve me in other ways, and I feel disposed to employ
you, if you would like to accept the engagement.
I cannot offer you as high pay as you
probably received at the circus, but am ready to
pay your travelling expenses and pay you five
dollars per week.</p>

<p>"Be kind enough to let me know at once whether
you will accept my offer, or rather, if you are
favorably disposed, come at once to New York
and call upon me at the St. Nicholas Hotel. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
will find me in room No. 35. I would suggest
that the sooner you can come to me the better.</p>

<p class="sigright">"Yours truly,&#8195;&#8195;<br />
"<span class="smcap">John Fitzgerald</span>."</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Robert read this letter with mingled surprise
and gratification. It was pleasant to think he
would soon be employed and earning his own
livelihood, and he could have thought of no engagement
more likely to suit him.</p>

<p>"What is your letter about, Robert?" asked
Sidney.</p>

<p>"Read it for yourself, Sidney," said Robert,
passing it to him. "What do you think of it?"
he asked, later.</p>

<p>"I think it is a splendid chance. I wouldn't
mind having such an offer myself."</p>

<p>"I think I am in luck," said Robert, complacently.</p>

<p>"Then you mean to accept it?"</p>

<p>"Certainly; I should be very foolish if I did
not. I have been wondering what I could get to
do, and this comes just in the nick of time."</p>

<p>"I am almost sorry the offer has come to you,
Robert. I had been expecting you would stay
with me a considerable time."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span></p>

<p>"I should be sure to enjoy it if I was willing to
be idle, but I have an independent spirit, and I
prefer to earn my own living. I will come back
and visit you some time if you will let me."</p>

<p>"Let you! I shall quarrel with you if you
don't. Perhaps, however, you would prefer to
visit Ronald Percy."</p>

<p>"I will wait at any rate till I receive an invitation,"
answered Robert, smiling, for he did not
feel in the least sensitive about the malicious contempt
which Ronald professed to feel for him.</p>

<p>"When will you start, Robert?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow morning. Mr. Fitzgerald seems
to be in a hurry, and there is no good reason for
delay. My foot is well enough for all ordinary
use, though it would give out if I should attempt
riding."</p>

<p>When Dr. Grey was shown the letter Robert
had received, he looked puzzled.</p>

<p>"Certainly the chance seems to be a good one,"
he said, "and doubtless it will be well to accept
it. It is certainly a remarkable piece of luck."</p>

<p>"So I consider it," said Robert.</p>

<p>"I mean, that it is like the events in a story
that you should have such a chance offer from an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
absolute stranger, just as you stand in need of it.
I should like to see this Mr. Fitzgerald," he continued,
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"I think I heard that there was a man of that
name staying at the hotel about a week since,"
said Sidney.</p>

<p>"He says he was present when Robert met
with his accident."</p>

<p>"Then it is probably the same one. Then you
have decided to accept, my boy?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; I shall go to New York to-morrow."</p>

<p>"It may be as well. But one thing I want to
say: if the engagement doesn't prove satisfactory,
or you are ever again thrown upon your own
resources, come back to us and you will have a
cordial welcome."</p>

<p>"Yes, Rob, you may be sure of that," said Sidney,
eagerly.</p>

<p>"You are both very kind to me," returned
Robert, gratefully, "and I will take you at your
word. By the way, Dr. Grey, I want to ask you
a favor."</p>

<p>"It is granted as soon as asked, my boy."</p>

<p>"It is only to keep the two hundred dollars I
have saved up for the present. It will be safer in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
your hands than mine, and I shan't need it, as all
my expenses are to be paid by my new employer,
and five dollars a week besides."</p>

<p>"I will keep it for you if you desire."</p>

<p>"Thank you; if I had it I might have it stolen
from me, and besides it would make me uncomfortable
to feel that I had so much money about
me."</p>

<p>"I see you are prudent. I have one good
reason for keeping it, as you will one day come
back and reclaim it."</p>

<p>The next morning Robert started for New
York.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XXIV.<br />
<span class="small">ROBERT MEETS HIS EMPLOYER.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="caps">R<span class="upper">obert Rudd</span> had been in New York more
than once, and he therefore had no difficulty
in finding out the fine hotel on Broadway known
as the St. Nicholas.</p>

<p>He entered it, and, walking up to the desk, inquired,
"Is Mr. John Fitzgerald staying here?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered the clerk. "Do you wish to
see him?"</p>

<p>"If you please."</p>

<p>"Then write your name on a card and I will
send it up."</p>

<p>Robert did so.</p>

<p>"See if No. 35 is in," said the clerk, calling a
hall boy, and handing him the card.</p>

<p>In five minutes the hall boy came back, saying:
"Mr. Fitzgerald wants the young gentleman to
come up."</p>

<p>Robert followed him to a room on the third
floor and knocked at the door.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span></p>

<p>"Come in," was heard from the interior.</p>

<p>On entering Robert looked with some curiosity
at the solitary occupant of the room, who was to
be his future employer. He saw a tall, dark-complexioned
man neatly dressed in a suit which appeared
to be new, since it had not lost its first
gloss.</p>

<p>Fitzgerald, for it was he, rose promptly, and
advanced to meet Robert with an air of great
cordiality.</p>

<p>"I am glad to see you, Mr. Rudd," he said, extending
his hand. "You were perhaps surprised
to receive my letter."</p>

<p>"I was still more pleased," answered Robert,
politely.</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear it, since it gives me the assurance
that you regard my offer favorably."</p>

<p>"Yes sir, I could not well do otherwise. It is
of a tempting character. I am only surprised that
you should make me such an offer, knowing so
little of me."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I know more of you than you imagine,"
said Fitzgerald to himself, with a peculiar
look which, however, Robert did not notice.</p>

<p>"I judge of persons quickly!" he said aloud,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
"and when first I saw you in the ring it occurred
to me that you were just the young person I
should like to have travel with me. Of course, I
didn't dream then that there was any possibility
of my securing you, for I was not prepared to pay
a sum as large as you were doubtless paid at the
circus. However, when you were injured by the
dastardly trick of some scoundrel, and I subsequently
learned that you would be unable to
ride for the remainder of the season, it occurred
to me that perhaps you would accept my proposal."</p>

<p>"I am very glad to do so, and I am very much
obliged to you for giving me such a chance. Do
you think I can fulfil the duties of the post?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I should think so. Favor me by writing a
line or two from this newspaper. I wish to judge
of your handwriting."</p>

<p>There were writing materials on the table, and
Robert complied with the request.</p>

<p>Though not a handsome writer, he wrote a
plain and legible hand, and with considerable readiness.</p>

<p>Fitzgerald scanned it hastily, and said, "Oh,
that will suit me very well."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you think I shall be competent to do all
you desire?"</p>

<p>"I feel sure of it. You have travelled considerably,
I presume?"</p>

<p>"Yes, with the circus."</p>

<p>"Precisely. Then you know something about
hotels, trains, etc. A boy who had always lived at
home would not suit me so well. Where is your
luggage?"</p>

<p>"I have only a gripsack&mdash;I mean valise&mdash;with
me."</p>

<p>"That is better. Travellers should not be encumbered
with too much baggage. It is a great
nuisance. Where is it?"</p>

<p>"I left it below."</p>

<p>"You can bring it up to my room. I won't
hire a room for you, for I intend to start this very
night for the West by a night train from the
Grand Central depot. That won't be too sudden
for you, will it?"</p>

<p>"O no, sir; I am entirely at your service. I
have nothing to detain me in New York."</p>

<p>"Go down and get your valise and bring it up
here, and I will give you my instructions."</p>

<p>"The boy has walked into the trap," said Fitzgerald,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
thoughtfully, when Robert left him. "He
is a fine boy, and seems a thorough little gentleman
in spite of the way in which he has been
brought up. It is a pity to harm him, but my
interests and that scoundrel Hugo's require it."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV.<br />
<span class="small">AT NIAGARA FALLS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="caps">R<span class="upper">obert</span> and his new employer started the
same morning on their western trip. From
the first Robert was haunted by the thought that
he had seen Fitzgerald somewhere before. The
man's features looked familiar to him, but he had
no associations, or could recall none, connected
with him. Fitzgerald, however, who remembered
very well his past connection with the boy, was
afraid that he would succeed in remembering him,
and grew uneasy when he saw Robert's bright, expressive
eyes fixed upon him.</p>

<p>"You seem interested in my appearance," he
said, dryly.</p>

<p>Robert answered quickly: "I beg your pardon,
Mr. Fitzgerald, for staring at you. Somehow
your features looked familiar to me, and I was
trying to think whether I had ever met you
before."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span></p>

<p>"Very possibly you may have seen me, for I
have been something of a traveller," answered his
employer; "but we never knew each other. I
should have remembered you."</p>

<p>"Very like I may have seen you at some place
where we gave an entertainment," said Robert.</p>

<p>"I was at Crampton, you know."</p>

<p>"I mean longer ago than that. I have a queer
feeling as if some time you were connected with
me in some way," said Robert, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>Fitzgerald was secretly uneasy. If Robert's
recollections should become clearer, and he should
come to suspect the truth, then good-by to his
plans, for the boy would of course be on his
guard. His ingenuity came to his aid.</p>

<p>"It is more likely," he said, in an apparently
indifferent tone, "that I resemble some such person.
The fact is," he added with a forced laugh,
"I once came near falling a victim to my unfortunate
resemblance to a rascal. I was arrested on
suspicion of being a forger or something of the
sort, because I looked like the real culprit. Of
course the truth came out, but not until I had
been subjected to some inconvenience."</p>

<p>This explanation seemed satisfactory to Robert,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
who gave up his scrutiny of his employer, convinced
that he had been deluded by a fancied or
real resemblance.</p>

<p>They made a day's stop at Buffalo, and went
from there to Niagara Falls, which Robert had
never before seen. He naturally derived a rare
enjoyment from the sight of the great cataract.
He was hurried away from the falls by Fitzgerald
in consequence of a conversation which the boy
had with a stranger, which grievously alarmed his
employer.</p>

<p>This is how it happened:</p>

<p>Robert and Fitzgerald were on Goat Island.
Our hero was looking earnestly at the mighty cataract,
and did not observe that a stranger was
looking earnestly at him. Fitzgerald had strayed
to a little distance, and was not within earshot.</p>

<p>Robert was roused from his revery by a tap
upon the shoulder.</p>

<p>Turning he saw a man of forty-five, well dressed,
and apparently a man of position.</p>

<p>"Did you wish to speak to me, sir?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered the stranger. "You will, perhaps,
think me curious if I ask your name?"</p>

<p>"My name is Robert Rudd."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span></p>

<p>Robert thought it probable that the stranger
had seen him riding somewhere, and recognized
him from this, though he could not call him by
name. But the name seemed to tell the inquirer
nothing. On the contrary, he appeared to be disappointed.</p>

<p>"I suppose I am mistaken, then," he said, apologetically;
"but I can only say in apology for my
curiosity, that you bear a remarkable resemblance
to an old school-mate of mine."</p>

<p>"Who was he?" asked Robert, eagerly.</p>

<p>It must be borne in mind that the boy knew
nothing of his own family, and earnestly desired,
though he never expected, to solve the mystery of
his birth.</p>

<p>"His name was Julian Richmond. Are you,
by chance, related to him?"</p>

<p>"Not that I know of," answered Robert, soberly.
"Would you mind telling me something about
him?"</p>

<p>Rather wondering at our hero's curiosity in regard
to a man of whom he had never before heard,
the stranger answered, "Certainly, if you would
like to hear. Julian and I were school-fellows together
in Albany, where I live now. His father,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
old Cornelius Richmond, was a rich man. I believe
he is still living on a fine estate along the
Hudson. When we grew up the Richmonds
moved away and I lost sight of them. I heard,
however, that Julian went out West and married.
A coldness sprang up between him and his father,
for what reason I don't know. I don't know
whether they were ever reconciled. At any rate,
poor Julian died, as I some time after heard, leaving
his father childless. If you were Julian's son
you could not look more like him."</p>

<p>Robert listened to this communication with intense
interest. Could it be that this Julian Richmond
was his father? It was the first clew of any
kind that he had ever found, and he repeated over
to himself the names of Julian and Cornelius Richmond,
determined to remember them, and some
time to make further inquiries.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Fitzgerald, turning, noticed that
Robert was conversing with a stranger. Though
he was far from suspecting that an important secret
has been revealed to the boy, he was naturally
of a cautious temperament, and he thought it imprudent
to allow Robert to become intimate with
any one, lest possibly when he disappeared he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
might be suspected of having had some agency in
the affair. He therefore walked up rapidly to
where the two were conversing.</p>

<p>"Robert," he called, when two rods distant.</p>

<p>Robert obeyed the summons.</p>

<p>"I think we will go back to the hotel. I have
something to do before leaving Niagara, and there
is not much time."</p>

<p>"O, Mr. Fitzgerald," said Robert, eagerly, "that
gentleman tells me I look very much like an old
school-mate of his."</p>

<p>Fitzgerald was instantly alarmed. He knew,
for Hugo had told him, that the boy bore a wonderful
resemblance to his dead father, and, of
course, that father must have old friends and acquaintances
who would see the resemblance and
possibly betray it to the boy.</p>

<p>"Is there anything so remarkable in that?" he
asked. "Probably there are hundreds of people
whom you resemble."</p>

<p>"But he said I looked as if I might be this man's
son," continued Robert.</p>

<p>"Did he mention the name of this old school-mate?"
inquired Fitzgerald, alarmed.</p>

<p>"Yes; he said his name was Julian Richmond."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span></p>

<p>If Robert had been watching the countenance
of his employer he would have seen a sudden look
of dismay which might have roused his suspicions,
but he was taking a last look at the great cataract.</p>

<p>"Very likely!" said Fitzgerald, after a slight
pause. "I have been told plenty of times that I
looked like this one and that one."</p>

<p>"But you know your family, and I do not. I
have no knowledge of who my father was, and
so I hoped that I might hear something that would
reveal it to me. May I ask the gentleman his
name? I might like to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No," answered Fitzgerald, with an abrupt
harshness that made Robert survey him in astonishment.
"You are too old to be so childish. I
have no time to lose. Come at once with me to
the hotel."</p>

<p>"It wouldn't take a minute."</p>

<p>"Do you hear what I say?" said his employer,
angrily.</p>

<p>Robert was too proud to make any further request.
He was puzzled at the extraordinary manner
of Fitzgerald, for which there seemed no occasion.
It was the first time that his new employer
had spoken to him harshly, and he was unable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
to account for it. He did not press the request,
being unwilling to subject himself to any
further rudeness. Had he known how important
that inquiry was, he would have made it at all
hazards. As it was, his curiosity had been excited,
but he had no suspicion that he was already on the
threshold of the secret which had always been
withheld from him.</p>

<p>Robert was proud, and his proud spirit rebelled
against his employer's rudeness; but he was not
in a position to break with him. He had taken
no money with him, and was of course dependent
upon Fitzgerald. He was hundreds of miles away
from his good friends the Greys, and it was the
part of prudence not to manifest the resentment
he felt. If he had had in his pocket the two hundred
dollars which belonged to him he might have
acted differently. As it was, he preserved a dignified
silence.</p>

<p>Fitzgerald, on arriving at the hotel, made arrangements
to leave at once. When they were
fairly on their way he changed his manner, became
conciliatory and affable, and apparently
endeavored to make Robert forget his harsh
words.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span></p>

<p>"I suppose he spoke hastily," thought Robert.
"He could not know how important it seemed to
me to make any inquiries about my family. At
any rate, I know the gentleman lives in Albany,
and some day I will hunt him up."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI.<br />
<span class="small">A VICTIM OF TREACHERY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="caps">A<span class="upper">rrived</span> in Chicago, Fitzgerald put up at the
Sherman House, and of course Robert accompanied
him.</p>

<p>Our hero was a little puzzled to understand why
he had been engaged. Little or nothing was given
him to do. Once or twice he had been employed
to buy tickets, or go on small errands, but his
office seemed to be a sinecure. This would have
suited many boys, but Robert was a boy of active
temperament, and felt happier to be employed.
I may remark here that, in general, nothing is
worse for a boy than to be absolutely unemployed,
for it is as true as the old proverb expresses itself,
that "Satan finds some mischief still for idle hands
to do."</p>

<p>One day Robert ventured to remark to his employer,
"I am afraid, Mr. Fitzgerald, I am not
earning my wages; I am quite ready to do more."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span></p>

<p>"That isn't your fault, Robert," said Fitzgerald.
"It is true, while we are travelling I don't find
much to do; but when we get to our destination I
shall keep you more busy."</p>

<p>"I am glad of that," said Robert, "for I feel
better to be employed."</p>

<p>"I believe I have never said anything about
the object of my journey," Fitzgerald continued.</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"I am employed by certain New York parties
to look after land and mining investments at the
West. I shall have to visit several places, and
there will be more or less writing to do, in which
I shall employ you. By the way" (they were now
in the hotel at Chicago), "I will dictate a letter
to you now."</p>

<p>"Very well, sir."</p>

<p>Robert took out writing materials and Fitzgerald
dictated the following:</p>


<blockquote>
<p class="sigleft">"<i>Ashley Robinson, Esq., 549 Broadway, New York</i>:</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>: I am not quite sure as to the tenor
of my instructions from you. Do I understand that
I am empowered to sell your land without further
communication with you, or do you wish me to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
apprise you of any offer I may receive? My own
impression is that you ought not to accept less
than $5000 for it, as it is sure to increase in
value. Please write me at once.</p>

<p class="sigright">"Yours truly,&#8195;&#8195;<br />
"<span class="smcap">John Fitzgerald</span>."</p>
</blockquote>


<p>"It is done," said Robert.</p>

<p>"You may go out and mail it. I should prefer
that you would take it to the post-office yourself,
as it will go quicker than if you mailed it in the
hotel, or put it in one of the street boxes. Any
one will tell you where the post-office is."</p>

<p>Robert went out, well pleased to have something
to do, and mailed the letter at the city post-office,
as directed.</p>

<p>Fitzgerald laughed to himself after the boy
went out.</p>

<p>"The boy little suspects that that is a bogus
letter, and that there is no such person as Ashley
Robinson in New York. If there is, I haven't
the honor of knowing him. It was rather a happy
idea of mine, as the boy's suspicion will not be so
easily aroused if he thinks I am engaged in a
legitimate business journey. Well, well, I shall
be glad when the job is accomplished, for it isn't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
overmuch to my taste. That villain Hugo might
find it to his mind. It is a pity that such fellows
should succeed in feathering their nests and getting
all the good things of this life. When this
work is done, I shall have a hold upon him, and it
won't be my fault if I don't make him pay handsomely
for doing his dirty work for him."</p>

<p>Presently Robert returned.</p>

<p>"Did you mail the letter?" asked his employer.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"That is well, for it was an important one."</p>

<p>"You forgot to tell your correspondent where
to write you," said Robert, to whom the omission
had occurred as he was returning.</p>

<p>Fitzgerald was for a moment embarrassed, but
he was a man of ready wit.</p>

<p>"Oh, he will know," he answered; "he will
address me at the town where his land is
located."</p>

<p>This seemed a plausible explanation, and Robert
said no more.</p>

<p>They walked to the railroad station with their
valises in hand.</p>

<p>On the way rather a rough-looking man accosted
Fitzgerald.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, Fitz, old fellow, how did you drop down
here?"</p>

<p>Fitzgerald flushed, and answered hurriedly&mdash;</p>

<p>"I came by cars from New York."</p>

<p>"I don't mean that. What's your lay, and who
have you got with you?"</p>

<p>"Excuse me, Brandon, I am in a hurry," Fitzgerald
answered, uncomfortably.</p>

<p>Brandon whistled.</p>

<p>"Something mysterious, eh?" he said.</p>

<p>"Not at all, but you must excuse me."</p>

<p>It seemed peculiar to Robert, who had seen considerable
of the world, that a reputable business
man should be addressed in the terms employed
by Brandon, and he looked his surprise.</p>

<p>"That man is an acquaintance I stumbled across
in one of my business journeys," explained Fitzgerald
when they passed on, "and he assumed undue
familiarity. A man stumbles across some
strange acquaintances; I prefer to steer clear of
such parties, but it is sometimes hard to shake
them off."</p>

<p>"He seemed very well acquainted," thought
Robert, but he said nothing. In fact he was considerably
at a loss what to think of his employer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
who chose to say very little of his past history.
He felt that he should not care to remain long
with him, but for the present there seemed no objection
to fill up the remainder of the season in
his employ.</p>

<p>From Chicago Robert and his employer travelled
northwest, till they entered the State of Minnesota.
Here, somewhat to Robert's surprise,
they left the cars at a small town, which I will
call Florence, and registered at a small hotel, which
I will call the Dearborn House. Probably our
hero looked surprised, and Fitzgerald volunteered
an explanation.</p>

<p>"It is here where Mr. Robertson's land is located,"
he said.</p>

<p>"I thought it was Mr. Robinson&mdash;Ashley Robinson,"
said Robert.</p>

<p>"To be sure," returned Fitzgerald, rather disconcerted,
for he had forgotten the name he had
extemporized in Chicago; "I am always making
mistakes about names. I have to enter everything
in my diary."</p>

<p>The morning after, Robert chanced to pick up a
piece of paper just outside his employer's door.
As there seemed to be writing upon it he picked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
it up, thinking that it might be of some importance.</p>

<p>On the scrap of paper there was a name which
immediately arrested Robert's interest&mdash;the name
of Hugo Richmond.</p>

<p>"Richmond," repeated Robert, in surprise.
"Why, that is the name of the man I was said so
strongly to resemble. Is it possible that Mr. Fitzgerald
knows him?"</p>

<p>Then he bethought himself that Richmond was
not an uncommon name and there was no necessary
connection between Hugo Richmond and the
Julian Richmond whom he resembled. Still the
discovery of this paper made him thoughtful. He
would have liked to question his employer, but
felt instinctively aware that it would do no good.
Besides, from the manner in which he had found
the paper, it would seem as if he were trying to
spy out his master's affairs.</p>

<p>"Robert," said Fitzgerald, after breakfast, "let
us go out and take a walk."</p>

<p>"With pleasure," answered the boy, politely.</p>

<p>"I am going out to take a look at Mr. Robinson's
land," said Fitzgerald.</p>

<p>"Has he much?"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, yes; he owns a quarter section, which he
took up some years since at the government's
price&mdash;a dollar and a quarter an acre. It must be
worth a good deal more now."</p>

<p>"I suppose he wants to sell?"</p>

<p>"Yes. He lives so far away that he can't well
look after it. Besides, by selling now he can make
a large profit."</p>

<p>"Do you think you can sell it readily, Mr. Fitzgerald?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I have written to a land speculator to
meet me here to-morrow. I think I can drive a
bargain with him. I shall make a good commission
myself on the sale."</p>

<p>"I am glad of it," said Robert, politely.</p>

<p>They left the road, and went across the fields
over the level, prairie-like land. In the distance
was a deserted cabin, which appeared to be partially
burned.</p>

<p>"Are you going to that cabin?" asked our hero.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered his employer. "That cabin
is on Mr. Robinson's land."</p>

<p>"Did he build it?"</p>

<p>"No; it was built by a squatter, who took advantage
of the owner being a non-resident, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
made himself at home here, without leave or
license. The cabin had not been erected long,
however, before it caught fire and was partially
burned."</p>

<p>"Does any one live there now?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>The two kept on their way till they reached the
deserted cabin.</p>

<p>A rod or two distant was an open well, which
seemed, as well as the cabin, to be disused.</p>

<p>"The squatter seems to have dug a well," said
Robert.</p>

<p>"Yes; I wonder whether it is deep," said Fitzgerald.</p>

<p>Naturally Robert advanced till he stood on the
brink of the well. An instant later and he was
pushed violently forward and fell into the yawning
pit.</p>

<p>"That disposes of him forever!" said Fitzgerald,
and turning, he fled swiftly from the spot,
leaving the victim of his treachery to his fate.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII.<br />
<span class="small">ROBERT FINDS HIMSELF IN A TIGHT PLACE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="caps">T<span class="upper">he</span> action of Fitzgerald was so rapid and unexpected
that Robert was unable to protect himself
in any way. He fell, but mechanically, as he
had seen trapeze performers do in the circus when
falling, he held himself erect, with his hands at
his sides, and dropped in that position into three
feet of water at the bottom of the well. Fortunately
for him the depth of the well was not
great, about fifteen feet, and he sustained no injury
to his limbs, the water, moreover, breaking
the force of the descent.</p>

<p>Still, when unexpectedly he found himself at
the bottom of the well, his situation was by no
means pleasant.</p>

<p>"What could have induced Mr. Fitzgerald to
push me in?" he asked himself in a bewildered
way. "What possible object could he have in
doing it?"</p>

<p>That his employer did push him he couldn't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
doubt, for he felt the push, which was a forcible
one. Yet it seemed so causeless, so utterly without
an object, that he was tempted to doubt the
testimony of his senses. To the reader, of course,
it is perfectly clear, but we have sources of information
that Robert had not.</p>

<p>He was not a boy to give up, though it certainly
looked hopeless to attempt to get out. Had the
well been at the East it would have been walled in
on all sides by rocks, but stones of any size are
not numerous in many parts of the West, and this
had originally been boarded, but some of the
boards had disappeared.</p>

<p>"It isn't very deep," thought Robert, "but how
in the world am I to get out?"</p>

<p>He made several attempts, but they were all
futile. Things began to look serious, for the
house was deserted, and probably very few persons
came that way.</p>

<p>While in a state of painful anxiety he heard,
faintly, a boy whistle. The sound became more
distinct as if the boy were approaching, and hope
was kindled in our hero's breast.</p>

<p>"If I could only attract his attention," he
thought.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span></p>

<p>He shouted as loud as he could, but the sound
was partially lost before it reached the surface of
the well. Still it attracted the attention of Fred
Lathrop, the boy who was whistling, who stopped
to listen.</p>

<p>"Where did that sound come from?" he
thought.</p>

<p>It was repeated, and this time he could distinguish
the word "Help!"</p>

<p>"By gracious, it comes from the well!" he said
to himself. "Who can be down there?"</p>

<p>He drew near and looked down. It was darker
near the bottom, but he could descry Robert, who
was looking up.</p>

<p>"Who's there?" asked Fred.</p>

<p>"It's I&mdash;a boy. Help me up!"</p>

<p>"How did you get down there?"</p>

<p>"Help me out and I'll tell you."</p>

<p>"I don't see how I am to do it," said Fred,
after a pause.</p>

<p>"Isn't there a rope round about there somewhere?"</p>

<p>"The old well-rope used to be coiled up in a
corner of the house; I don't know whether it's
there now."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span></p>

<p>"Look&mdash;will you?"</p>

<p>Fred needed no second request. He went to
the house and was fortunate enough to find the rope.
He brought it with him to the edge of the well.</p>

<p>"I've got it!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Throw one end to me."</p>

<p>This was done.</p>

<p>"Now, do you think you can pull hard enough
to draw me out? I will help myself with my
feet."</p>

<p>"I am afraid I'm not strong enough."</p>

<p>"Suppose you try," said Robert, who didn't
like to give up the hope of an immediate escape.</p>

<p>"Stop, there's my brother-in-law coming across
the fields," said Fred, eagerly. "He will help
me."</p>

<p>"Mr. Davis!" he cried, "come here and help
me."</p>

<p>"What are you up to, Fred?" inquired the
young man addressed. "Are you fishing in the
well?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I am fishing&mdash;for a boy," responded
Fred.</p>

<p>"Are you gone crazy?"</p>

<p>"No; come here and look for yourself."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span></p>

<p>Davis did so, and was sensible enough to understand,
though very much surprised, that it would
be best to postpone his inquiries till the boy was
rescued.</p>

<p>"Give me hold of the rope!" he said. "Now,
you boy down there, can you give a good, firm
grip?"</p>

<p>"Try me and see."</p>

<p>"If you let it slip through your fingers you will
fall back and hurt yourself."</p>

<p>"I won't let it slip. Keep firm hold yourself."</p>

<p>It was not altogether an easy task, and Robert
was rubbed unpleasantly against the sides of the
well; but at length victory crowned the efforts of
the three, and our hero, his clothes looking none
the better for his immersion in the water, and his
contact with the sides of the well gave him a decided
tramp-like appearance.</p>

<p>"Well, here you are!" said Mr. Davis. "How
did you get into the well? Did you fall in?"</p>

<p>"I was pushed in," answered Robert.</p>

<p>"Pushed in!" repeated Fred and his brother-in-law
in concert.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Who pushed you in?"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span></p>

<p>"My employer&mdash;the man I was travelling with."</p>

<p>"What made him do it?"</p>

<p>"That is more than I can tell."</p>

<p>"Was he angry with you?"</p>

<p>"There had been no quarrel nor disagreement,
and I supposed we were excellent friends."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't fancy such a friend," said Fred,
dryly.</p>

<p>"The man must have had some motive," said
Mr. Davis, who was a young lawyer.</p>

<p>"I can't think of any. I think he may have
been insane," said Robert, to whom this had occurred
as a possible solution of the problem.</p>

<p>"How long had you been with him?"</p>

<p>"Only about a week. He proposed to me to
take a walk this morning, and brought me here."</p>

<p>"Your clothes look the worse for the fall," said
Fred.</p>

<p>"Yes, I look like a tramp," answered Robert,
glancing down at his wet and muddy clothes with
disgust. "I've got another suit at the hotel, unless
Mr. Fitzgerald has carried off my valise. I don't
much like going back there in this trim."</p>

<p>"You needn't," said Fred. "Come home with
me. You are about my size; I will lend you one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
of my suits, while yours is being cleansed and
dried."</p>

<p>"Thank you!" said Robert, relieved; "you are
very kind. And what will your mother say when
she sees you bringing such a looking tramp home
with you?"</p>

<p>"Don't trouble yourself about that," said Fred.
"Mother will understand it. She'll see that even
if you do look like a tramp you're not a professional."</p>

<p>"That's just what I am," responded Robert,
smiling. "I am a professional&mdash;circus rider."</p>

<p>"You don't say so!" exclaimed Fred, with something
of interest. "Are you a bareback rider?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"We've got a horse in the barn. Won't you
try riding on him?"</p>

<p>"Oh, the horse has to be trained as well as the
rider: I can't perform on a horse that has never
been in the ring."</p>

<p>"Then how did you happen to be with this man
that served you such a trick?"</p>

<p>Robert explained.</p>

<p>Quarter of an hour's walk brought them to a
substantial farm-house occupied by Fred's family.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
He introduced Robert to his mother&mdash;a pleasant-faced
lady, who received our hero cordially, especially
after she had been informed of the manner
in which he had been treated by his employer.</p>

<p>Fred took Robert up to his own bedroom,
where he placed one of his own suits at his disposal.
The soiled suit was taken down-stairs,
where it was first dried by the fire and afterwards
brushed clean till it once more assumed the respectable
look which rightfully belonged to it.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Fred went round to the hotel to ascertain
whether Fitzgerald had made his appearance.</p>

<p>He ascertained that he had returned and reported
that the boy had gone on to the next town,
where he was to join him. He paid the bill of
both, took both valises and drove to the nearest
railway station.</p>

<p>"He's taken French leave!" said Fred. "He
evidently never expects to see you again."</p>

<p>"He may be disappointed in that," said Robert,
quietly; "I may appear to him when he least expects
it. I intend to find out if I can what was
his object in throwing me into the well."</p>

<p>"That's where I'm with you!" said Fred. "I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
wouldn't let him go unpunished for such an outrage."</p>

<p>When Robert came to reflect upon his situation,
however, he felt embarrassed. His bills, of
course, had been paid by Fitzgerald, and he had
not yet received any wages. The consequence
was, that while he was nearly two thousand miles
distant from his starting-point, he had but a dollar
and a half in his pocket. He might, to be sure,
write to Dr. Grey for a portion of his savings, but
it would take some time for the remittance to
arrive.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII.<br />
<span class="small">ROBERT SUBDUES A HORSE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="caps">R<span class="upper">obert</span> somehow had an objection to sending
to Dr. Grey for money, though the money
was his own. It seemed like a confession of failure,
and he did not care to write what sort of an
accident had befallen him, since it would involve
long explanations. Therefore, though he had but
a dollar and a half left, he decided to set out on
his way home; that is, towards the East, trusting
to luck to get along. Though this was, perhaps
rash, it was not so rash in Robert's case as it would
have been in the case of an average boy, for he had
been accustomed to earn his own living and possessed
some talents and accomplishments which he
could turn to account.</p>

<p>He took leave of his good friends, the Lathrops,
without betraying to them his condition, or they
would have insisted upon giving him substantial
aid. As it was, Mrs. Lathrop insisted upon preparing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
with her own hands, a substantial lunch,
which in due time Robert found very acceptable.</p>

<p>He set out on his journey on foot. His small
capital would not allow him to travel in any other
way. His clothes had been dried and pressed,
and he presented a neat appearance, so that he was
not likely to be taken for a tramp, though in his
earlier days he had travelled in that character.</p>

<p>He walked in a leisurely way during the forenoon,
and about noon sat down under a tree and
ate his lunch. It was a plentiful one, but Robert,
whose appetite had been sharpened by his
walk, did full justice to it. In fact he ate it all.</p>

<p>"There's no particular hurry," he thought;
"I may as well lie here for awhile and rest during
the heat of the day."</p>

<p>It was not quite 2 o'clock when he was roused
from a revery by hearing carriage wheels. He
looked up and saw a lady in a four-wheel carriage,
drawn by a horse who was inclined to be fractious.
The lady driver was evidently anxious,
for she pulled the reins frantically, and called
out, "Whoa! you sir! Why don't you behave?
Oh dear, what shall I do?"</p>

<p>The horse shook his head, pranced, backed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
and was evidently prepared to make trouble,
much to the discomfort and alarm of the lady.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! I wish I hadn't come alone!" she
exclaimed. "I didn't think Prince would behave
so. It's lucky if I don't get my neck
broken!"</p>

<p>The horse was quite aware that he was master
of the situation, and that his driver had lost her
presence of mind, and, with a perversity which
we sometimes see in horses, made up his mind to
act as badly as possible.</p>

<p>So occupied was the lady that she did not see
the boy, who sat under a tree by the roadside, nor
suspected that in him she was to find a deliverer.</p>

<p>If there was any one accustomed to horses, and
utterly without fear of them, it was Robert, as
may be supposed from the nature of his training.
He sprang to his feet when he perceived the
situation, and, running forward, took off his hat,
and asked politely, "Can I be of any service to
you, madam?"</p>

<p>"Can you drive horses?" asked the lady, doubtfully.</p>

<p>Robert smiled.</p>

<p>"I'm used to them," he answered.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span></p>

<p>"Then won't you get in and drive for me?
Prince is acting very badly to-day."</p>

<p>Robert did not wait for the carriage to stop,
but with his usual activity clambered in, and was
at the lady's side in an instant.</p>

<p>"Now," he said, "let me take the reins."</p>

<p>"If you are sure that you can drive," said Miss
Stafford, doubtfully.</p>

<p>"You shall see for yourself," answered Robert,
confidently.</p>

<p>He held the reins with a firm hand. The
horse, though immediately sensible that there was
a new hand at the helm, if I may speak figuratively,
wasn't quite ready to yield.</p>

<p>Seeing that he was still fractious, Robert took
the whip and brought it down smartly on the
horse's flanks.</p>

<p>"Oh, what are you doing?" asked the lady in
alarm. "Prince will run away with us!"</p>

<p>"Let him try it," said Robert, his eyes flashing.
"If I can't subdue him, I'll sell out to some
one that can!"</p>

<p>This was a boy's expression, but his confident
manner served to reassure Miss Stafford, though
Prince did really undertake to run. The road,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
however, was good, there were no carriages to encounter,
and Robert gave him his head, holding
the reins, however, in a strong, firm grasp.</p>

<p>"I never rode so fast in my life!" said Miss
Stafford nervously, as they flew over the road.
"Don't let us tip over."</p>

<p>"No, ma'am, I won't."</p>

<p>After a while Prince slackened his speed. It
was rather a warm day, and he found that it was
not quite so good fun running as he found it
when he felt that his driver was frightened&mdash;now
the least sign of fractiousness was instantly followed
by a smart stroke of the whip.</p>

<p>"I believe you do understand horses," said Miss
Stafford at length.</p>

<p>"It's my business to understand them," answered
Robert.</p>

<p>"You ain't a&mdash;jockey, are you?" asked the lady.</p>

<p>"No; I have been a circus-rider."</p>

<p>"You don't say so!" ejaculated the lady. "You
can't jump through hoops and all them things, can
you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am."</p>

<p>"You are not with a circus now, are you?"</p>

<p>Robert explained that he had left circus life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
for a time, but had been thrown out of employment
unexpectedly.</p>

<p>"I am going to a birthday party of a little niece
of mine," said Miss Stafford. "She is twelve
years old to-day. There will be twenty or thirty
boys and girls there. I wish you could do something
to amuse them. It would make us all the
more welcome."</p>

<p>"I am a little of a magician," said Robert. "If
you think they would like to see some tricks&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The very thing!" exclaimed Miss Stafford,
enthusiastically. "They are all fond of tricks.
Where did you learn?"</p>

<p>When Miss Stafford was informed that Robert
had learned of a real magician, that is of a professor
of magic, she was very much pleased.</p>

<p>"I will engage you, then," she said, "for the
afternoon and evening. When I say engage you,
I mean I will pay you for your trouble."</p>

<p>"Oh, I won't charge anything," said Robert.</p>

<p>"But you must!" said the lady positively.
"Louisa Stafford never allows any one to work
for nothing. Besides you have perhaps prevented
Prince here from breaking my neck. I
certainly won't be mean enough to make you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
work for nothing. I warrant you are not over-provided
with money."</p>

<p>"Well, no," answered Robert, smiling. "I
can't say I am. I have only a dollar and a half
here, though I have some money in the hands of
a friend at the East."</p>

<p>"And how far are you expecting to travel?"</p>

<p>"To New York."</p>

<p>"To New York&mdash;almost two thousand miles&mdash;on
a dollar and a half! Goodness gracious, what
a wild idea!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I expect to find something to do on the
way, and if I don't I shall meet with good
friends."</p>

<p>"A dollar and a half! I never heard of such
a thing!" reiterated Miss Stafford.</p>

<p>Miss Louisa Stafford was a rich and kind-hearted
maiden lady, who, unlike many of her
class, was very fond of young people and a
great favorite with them. No gathering of her
nephews or nieces was considered complete without
the presence of Aunt Louisa, who was sure
in every way to promote the happiness of the
young company. She was delighted to secure in
Robert one who could so materially help her, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
inwardly resolved to reward him well for his services.</p>

<p>They drove up to a large house with a broad
lawn, shaded by fine trees, under which were assembled
a merry crowd of young people. When
Miss Stafford's carriage was espied there was a
rush to greet her.</p>

<p>"How are you all, children?" she said, heartily.
"Oh; I see you are looking at this young
gentleman with me. Well, he has saved my
life."</p>

<p>"Saved your life!" exclaimed the children in
chorus.</p>

<p>"Yes, Prince undertook to run away with and
upset me, but Master Robert, here (she had inquired
his name), subdued him, and here I am.
I have taken the liberty to invite Professor Rudd
to join our party."</p>

<p>"Professor Rudd!" repeated the children, bewildered.</p>

<p>"Yes; this young gentleman is a professor of
magic, and he will perform some tricks this evening.
This afternoon I expect you to be polite to
him, and invite him to join your games."</p>

<p>This all were very ready to do, for Robert was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
good-looking and gentlemanly in appearance, and
soon made himself a general favorite.</p>

<p>Supper was served between five and six o'clock,
and early in the evening Robert appeared as a
magician. He had quite a variety of tricks and
illustrations, and this part of the programme gave
great satisfaction.</p>

<p>The next morning (for Miss Stafford and Robert
also passed the night in the hospitable mansion)
when our young hero was ready to start out
on his journey, Miss Stafford, put in his hand a
sealed envelope.</p>

<p>"Don't open this," she said, "till you have
gone at least a mile."</p>




<hr />

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XXIX.<br />
<span class="small">AN UNPLEASANT ACQUAINTANCE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="caps">R<span class="upper">obert</span> felt curious to learn what was in the
letter, but faithfully carried out the wishes
of Miss Stafford, and did not open it till he was
more than a mile away.</p>

<p>On opening it, to his surprise he found inclosed
two $10 bills, with the following words
written in pencil:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>"<span class="smcap">My Young Friend Robert</span>: I desire you to
accept the inclosed and hope you will find it of
use. You needn't hesitate, for it comes from a
crusty old maid who has more than her share of
this world's goods, and likes to do a little good as
she goes along in life, instead of saving up thousands
for heirs who might squander it. Accept
my good wishes and thanks beside for the service
you have done me in taming a perverse brute, and
when you are again in this vicinity be sure to
call on your friend,</p>

<p class="sigright">"<span class="smcap">Louisa Stafford</span>."</p>
</blockquote>


                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span></p>

<p>"The old lady's a trump!" exclaimed Robert
warmly. "There isn't one in a thousand that
would be so generous. This is a regular windfall
to me as I am situated now. Now I shan't
be obliged to send to Dr. Grey for part of my
savings."</p>

<p>Robert continued on his way with a light
heart, for it is wonderfully cheering to think that
one has money enough to pay for rest and food at
the close of the day. Our young hero decided
that he would not walk all the way to the East,
but would on the day following take the cars at
any convenient station.</p>

<p>Pursuing his journey, he came to a portion of
the road which ran through the primeval forests,
he felt it to be rather a relief, for the morning
was well advanced, and the sun began to make
him uncomfortably warm. He soon had occasion
to learn that to be warm is not the most undesirable
thing that can happen to a traveller.</p>

<p>Half a mile from the entrance of the wood he
saw sitting on the fallen trunk of a tree a rough-looking
fellow, whose face looked even more repulsive
than usual from a short black beard which
appeared to be of a week's growth. He looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
like what he was&mdash;a tramp, who was so from
choice, even more than from necessity.</p>

<p>"What an ill-looking fellow!" thought Robert.</p>

<p>The man looked up, and scanned the boy curiously.</p>

<p>"Hallo, young chap!" he said.</p>

<p>"Hallo!" returned Robert.</p>

<p>"Have you got any tobacco about you?" inquired
the tramp.</p>

<p>"No, I never use it."</p>

<p>"Then have you a cigar? That will do just
as well."</p>

<p>"No; I don't smoke at all."</p>

<p>"Oh, you are an innocent baby!" said the man,
with a sneer of disappointment.</p>

<p>Robert did not think it necessary to reply, but
was moving on, being anxious to get away from
so undesirable a companion as soon as possible.</p>

<p>"Stop a minute, boy&mdash;don't be in such a
hurry," said the man.</p>

<p>"If you have anything to say to me I will listen,"
said Robert, coldly.</p>

<p>"You will, will you? You're mighty accommodatin'!
Where are you goin'?"</p>

<p>"Straight ahead!"</p>


<div class="figcenter">

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span></p>

<p>"Any fool would know that. That isn't an
answer."</p>

<p>"Why do you wish to know?" retorted Robert.</p>

<p>"That's my business!" said the tramp, his repulsive
features assuming an ugly expression.
"You'd better answer my question."</p>

<p>Robert thought on the whole it would be prudent
to avoid trouble by keeping on as good terms
as possible with the man.</p>

<p>"I can't tell you," he said, "for I don't know
myself. I expect to keep on till I get to New
York."</p>

<p>"That's where I'm goin'! Suppose we keep
company," said the man with a grin.</p>

<p>"We can keep company for the present, if you
wish," answered Robert, trying to repress his disgust.</p>

<p>"Look here, young fellow! Have you got any
money?" asked the tramp with a sidelong glance.</p>

<p>Robert was not surprised at this inquiry, for
he had expected it, but in spite of his courage it
alarmed him, for he could see that he was no
match in physical strength for this ill-looking
man.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span></p>

<p>"A little!" he answered.</p>

<p>"How much?"</p>

<p>"That's my business," answered Robert, provoked.
"I don't ask how much money you've
got."</p>

<p>"I haven't a cent," said the tramp, "but," he
added, significantly, "I'm going to have some
soon."</p>

<p>The look which accompanied this declaration
made it evident what he meant, and Robert
looked about to see what chance he had of escape
if the worst came to the worst. As to surrendering
the $20 for which he had been indebted to
the generosity of Miss Stratton, he had no intention
of doing it, unless it should be absolutely
necessary.</p>

<p>"I have nothing to do with your affairs," said
Robert. "If you'll let me know which way you
are going, I'll go the other way."</p>

<p>"Will you so? No, boy, you don't get rid of
me so easily. We're goin' the same way. If you
want to leave you can, but you must hand over
your money first."</p>

<p>"Are you a thief, then?" demanded Robert,
quickly.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span></p>

<p>"No; and you'd better not call me so. I'm
only goin' to borrer your money; I'll give you
my note for it," returned the tramp with a cunning
grin.</p>

<p>"I decline to lend," said Robert stoutly.</p>

<p>"Look here, my young chicken!" said the man
in a menacing tone. Ain't you crowin' rather
too loud for a bantem? Do you know who I
am?"</p>

<p>"No, but I can guess."</p>

<p>"Guess, then?"</p>

<p>"You're a man whose company I do not like."</p>

<p>The tramp laughed. Instead of offending, the
reply appeared to amuse him.</p>

<p>"That's true enough, I reckon. Well, I'm a
man that don't stand no nonsense. I want your
money."</p>

<p>He advanced towards Robert in a menacing
manner, and our hero, who had been looking
about him, jumped aside nimbly, and seizing the
branch of a tree swung himself up into the
branches, before his companion clearly understood
his intention.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's your game, is it?" he said, angrily.
"It won't do!"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span></p>

<p>He darted forward, but Robert bad been too
quick for him, and was already out of reach. He
was light and agile by nature, and his training in
the ring had helped to make him more so.</p>

<p>"So you think you've escaped me, do you?" he
demanded with an oath.</p>

<p>Robert did not answer, but looked calmly down
upon him from the tree.</p>

<p>"Come down at once!"</p>

<p>"Thank you; I'd rather stay here," said our
hero calmly.</p>

<p>Without a word the tramp made an effort to
follow Robert up the tree.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX.<br />
<span class="small">THE TREE OF REFUGE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="caps">T<span class="upper">he</span> tramp was stout and clumsily made, and
although he was strongly made he was not
agile. Moreover, the branch by which Robert
had helped himself upward was over six feet
from the ground, and had only been reached by a
leap. The trunk of the tree was large in circumference,
and afforded no facilities for climbing.
The efforts of the pursuer, therefore, were vain.</p>

<p>"Come down!" he shouted, peremptorily.</p>

<p>"I have already said that I am very comfortable
here," answered Robert.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to defy me?"</p>

<p>"I don't wish to have anything to do with
you."</p>

<p>"I wish I had a pistol!" muttered the tramp.
"I'd soon have you down then."</p>

<p>Robert was devoutly thankful that he was not
provided with such a weapon. He felt relieved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
by the discovery, for it had occurred to him as
possible, and in that event he would have had to
make a virtue of necessity and come down.</p>

<p>"Why didn't I lay hold of the boy when I had
him beside me?" thought the disappointed tramp.
"Who would have thought he could have sprung
up like that?"</p>

<p>He determined to try once more what he could
accomplish by threats.</p>

<p>"Look here, boy, if you know what's best for
yourself, you'll come down!" he cried, furiously.</p>

<p>"I think it's best for me to remain up here,"
said Robert.</p>

<p>"When you come down I'll wring your neck,
you little rascal!"</p>

<p>"That isn't much inducement for me to come
down," said Robert, coolly.</p>

<p>"If you come down within five minutes and
hand over your money, I'll let you go without
doing you any harm."</p>

<p>"That's very kind of you, but I need it myself."</p>

<p>Robert's coolness incensed the tramp, who
would have felt more satisfaction if his intended
victim had exhibited terror.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span></p>

<p>Robert was reminded of the scene in the woods
at Crampton, where Mr. Tarbox had besieged
Charlie Davis and himself, and the trick by which
they had then escaped. This would not work
now, and indeed it didn't seem clear how he was
to escape at all. There was nothing but to remain
up in the tree, and try to tire out the patience
of the thievish tramp.</p>

<p>Twenty minutes passed. They passed slowly
for Robert, but they also passed slowly for his besieger,
who was in a hurry to get possession of
the boy's money, and feared some one might come
along to whom he could appeal for help. If he
had known that Robert had twenty dollars in his
pocket his eagerness would have increased.</p>

<p>"Are you coming down?" he demanded, looking
up in the tree fiercely.</p>

<p>"When you are gone away," answered the boy,
composedly.</p>

<p>"If you wait much longer I'll murder you
when you do come down. You may think I won't
do it, but I'm savage enough to do anything."</p>

<p>"I don't doubt it at all," said our hero.</p>

<p>"I might tell you of how I've served other
persons who trifled with me."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span></p>

<p>"Do!" replied Robert. "It'll take up the time."</p>

<p>"No," answered the tramp, suspiciously. "I
don't care to have you inform against me, but I
want you to remember that I am a desperate
man."</p>

<p>"I'll take it for granted. I don't want to fall
into the hands of such a man."</p>

<p>The tramp hunted about for a stone to throw
at the boy, but in that part of the West stones
are not as plenty as in New England, and his
kind intentions were frustrated.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you think I'll go away after a while,"
he said presently, "but that's where you make a
mistake. I will stay here all night, if necessary."</p>

<p>He looked as if he would really carry out his
threat, and Robert, it must be admitted, in spite
of his coolness of demeanor, began to feel anxious.</p>

<p>"What an obstinate ruffian!" he thought. "If
he keeps his word, it will be decidedly uncomfortable
for me."</p>

<p>"Will no one come along?"</p>

<p>That was the thought that kept recurring to
him. It seemed to offer the only means of escape.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span></p>

<p>At last he heard wheels, and was thankful. So
did the tramp, and felt uneasy. But when the
carriage came along it turned out to contain a
woman and young boy. It would do no good to
hail them, for they could not help him, and the
tramp might be led to attack and rob them. So
Robert was constrained to let the carriage pass,
and to find himself once more in solitude with
the tramp.</p>

<p>"You did well not to speak," said the latter,
grimly. "If you had I would have robbed her,
too."</p>

<p>"Just what I thought," returned Robert.
"That seems to be your business."</p>

<p>"Don't be impudent, boy!"</p>

<p>"Isn't it the truth?"</p>

<p>"Come down and you'll find out."</p>

<p>"I know well enough already."</p>

<p>Another half hour passed, and no one came by.
At last the two heard a sound and a man whistling;
the same seemed approaching.</p>

<p>"I hope it's a strong, able-bodied man," thought
Robert.</p>

<p>When at length the man came in sight, a great
tide of joy swept over him. It was the very man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
whose presence he would have desired above all
others. It was Hercules, who had at one time
been employed in the same circus with himself,
to perform feats of strength.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XXXI.<br />
<span class="small">HERCULES&mdash;THE STRONG MAN.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="caps">"H<span class="upper">ercules</span>!" cried Robert, joyfully, from
his perch in the tree.</p>

<p>Hercules paused and looked about in surprise,
for he saw no one except an ill-looking tramp,
who, he was sure, had not spoken to him. He
thought he recognized the voice, but was not certain.</p>

<p>"Who is it calls me?" he asked. "Where are
you?"</p>

<p>"Here, in this tree."</p>

<p>Then Hercules espied our hero and recognized
him.</p>

<p>"Robert Rudd," he cried, in mingled surprise
and joy.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is I."</p>

<p>"What are you doing here? I had no idea of
seeing you here."</p>

<p>"Nor I you; but I am glad you came along."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span></p>

<p>"Why are you up there?"</p>

<p>"Because the gentleman below insists upon my
giving him my money, and I have a use for it myself."</p>

<p>"Ha!" said Hercules, eying the besieging
force narrowly. "Well, he looks like a thief and
a scoundrel."</p>

<p>Meantime, as may readily be imagined, the
tramp had been busily scanning him. Now the
appearance of Hercules was very deceptive. He
was not a man of large, powerful frame&mdash;indeed
he did not look as strong as the tramp; but his
sinews were of iron and his muscles were immense,
but these were concealed by his clothing.
Only in the ring, when he performed his feats of
strength, were they displayed to advantage. The
tramp was not a classical scholar, or the name
Hercules might have told him something. As it
were he really thought himself the more powerful
man of the two, and it came into his mind that he
might as well enlarge his schemes of plunder and
force this new acquaintance to pay tribute as well
as the boy whom he was besieging.</p>

<p>"You call me a thief and a scoundrel, do you?"
he said, flaming up in fierce wrath.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, I do," returned Hercules, eying him
coolly.</p>

<p>"How dare you do it?"</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't I?" said Hercules, contemptuously.
"Didn't you mean to rob this boy if I
hadn't come along?"</p>

<p>"I will do it yet, but I have business with you
first."</p>

<p>"What kind of business?"</p>

<p>"Empty your pockets, and don't be long about
it," said the tramp, approaching Hercules menacingly.</p>

<p>It had never occurred to Robert that the tramp
would attempt anything so absurd as to attack
the professional champion, whose name was famous
for strength, and when he saw that such
was his intention he laughed aloud in amazement.</p>

<p>"Don't crow, young rooster!" cried the tramp,
angrily. "I'll tackle your friend first; your turn
will come by and by."</p>

<p>"Oh, you want to have a tussle with me, do
you?" said Hercules, eying the other with a smile
of amusement.</p>

<p>"Yes, I'll finish you up in short order," said the
tramp, boastfully.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't be afraid, Hercules!" cried Robert, with
a laugh.</p>

<p>"I'll try not to. So you want me to hand over
my money, do you?" he said.</p>

<p>"Yes; and you'd better be quick about it, too,"
growled the tramp.</p>

<p>"Suppose I don't?"</p>

<p>"Then I'll whip you till you can't stand."</p>

<p>"This is better than any circus I ever attended,"
said Robert, delighted.</p>

<p>"He'll think it's a circus before he gets
through," said Hercules, significantly. "Well,
my ill-looking friend, I must inform you in the
outset that you are taking a good deal of trouble
for a very little. My stock of money is very
low."</p>

<p>"I don't care; you can hand over what you've
got."</p>

<p>"Or fight for it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," growled the tramp.</p>

<p>"I think I'll fight&mdash;a little friendly encounter.
It's the custom to shake hands first; will you do
it?"</p>

<p>The tramp extended his hand, which Hercules
at once grasped with such an iron pressure that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
the tramp fairly danced and howled with pain,
while the veins swelled upon his forehead.</p>

<p>"Let go!" he yelled.</p>

<p>Hercules released his hand with a laugh.</p>

<p>"It's only a small lesson, my friend. Do you
want my money now?"</p>

<p>"Who are you?" asked the tramp, with the addition
of an oath.</p>

<p>"I am Hercules, the strong man. You made a
mistake when you tackled me."</p>

<p>"I'm off, then," said the tramp.</p>

<p>"Not quite yet. You need a further lesson."</p>

<p>So saying, Hercules seized the tramp suddenly,
raised him aloft, threw him up in the air, and
then hurled him to the distance of a couple
of rods, where he lay stunned for a minute or
two.</p>

<p>"Now clear out!" said Hercules sternly, as the
rascal rose to his feet and limped off. "I would
give you in charge if it were not too much trouble.
Never let me set eyes on you again!"</p>

<p>"I won't if I can help it," muttered the tramp
as he slunk away.</p>

<p>"Now, Robert, come down from the tree, and
tell me all about yourself."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span></p>

<p>Robert told his story, and asked Hercules for
similar information.</p>

<p>"I've been to see a sister who lives near here,"
he said, "and now am on my way back to North's
circus, where I am engaged."</p>

<p>"Where are they?"</p>

<p>"At Athens."</p>

<p>"How far off is that?"</p>

<p>"Only ten miles."</p>

<p>"Is there anything for me?" asked Robert,
eagerly. "I want to work my way back to the
East."</p>

<p>"They've got a rider&mdash;but I forgot, your doctor
won't let you ride. If you don't mind selling at
the lemonade stand, there'll be a chance. They've
sent off the boy that worked for them the first of
the season. Young Ajax is with the circus, and
others whom you know."</p>

<p>"I'll go."</p>

<p>The same night the two friends joined North's
circus, and set out on a leisurely return to the
East.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXII.<br />
<span class="small">FITZGERALD'S DISAPPOINTMENT.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="caps">W<span class="upper">e</span> must now go back to Chestnutwood, where
the old man, Cornelius Richmond, though
blessed with a large share of the gifts of fortune,
was passing his declining years in loneliness, with
no one of his kindred near him except his nephew,
Hugo. For years Hugo had been his constant
companion; in manner, at least, he had been devoted
to his uncle, yet the old man had never been
drawn to him. Sometimes he reproached himself
because he could not feel more warmly towards
his nephew.</p>

<p>"Hugo seems devoted to me," he said to himself.
"Why is it that I cannot thoroughly like
him? It must be because my heart is in the
grave of my son Julian. Ah, if only his son were
living, that I might have my grandson with me.
That boy whom I saw riding in the circus&mdash;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
could get to love him for his resemblance to my
son; but Hugo tells me he has lost all traces of
him."</p>

<p>The simple old man little suspected that his
crafty nephew had taken effectual means to prevent
his ever seeing any more of this boy, towards
whom he felt a yearning affection, for which we
can account, though he could not. Indeed, he
was not a man to suspect guile of any one, being
in himself so guileless, and he really thought that
Hugo's attentions were dictated by genuine affection,
instead of selfish scheming for his uncle's
wealth.</p>

<p>"You have heard nothing more about the boy,
Hugo?" he asked one morning.</p>

<p>"No, uncle," answered Hugo, suppressing an
expression of impatience.</p>

<p>"It is strange."</p>

<p>"I am afraid you would be disappointed in him,
even if we could find him, and bring him here,
Uncle Cornelius."</p>

<p>"No, I should not be disappointed, for I should
not expect too much. It would be a pleasure to
look upon the boy's face, and think my lost Julian
was again before me."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span></p>

<p>"The old fool!" muttered Hugo under his
breath. "Will he never quit harping on that
boy?"</p>

<p>"You must remember that he has been brought
up in a circus, amid very objectionable associations,
uncle," he said aloud. "What can be expected
under such circumstances?"</p>

<p>"What is his name?"</p>

<p>"His circus name is Robert Rudd."</p>

<p>The old man repeated it softly to himself.</p>

<p>The same day he sent for a lawyer, and professed
his intention to modify his will.</p>

<p>Hugo was alarmed.</p>

<p>"Can he be going to leave anything to that
boy?" he asked himself.</p>

<p>He would have liked to have asked his uncle,
but only contrived to hint a question, to which
the old man replied evasively. In reality, he had
appended a codicil to his will, bequeathing the
sum of ten thousand dollars "to the young circus
rider, generally known as Robert Rudd," and did
not like to mention it to Hugo lest the latter
should remonstrate with him, and the old man
felt too weak to argue.</p>

<p>"There will be enough left for Hugo," he said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
to himself. "Ten thousand dollars is but a small
part of my property."</p>

<p>"It is very lucky," thought Hugo, "that I
made arrangements with Fitzgerald to dispose
of the boy, in case my uncle has done anything
foolish in his will. It will save litigation and
trouble."</p>

<p>He looked at the old man&mdash;frail, feeble, apparently
on the verge of the grave&mdash;and reflected
with impatience that as he looked now he had
looked for five years past. His hold on life was
tenacious.</p>

<p>"Good heavens! He may live for five or ten
years yet!" thought Hugo. "He looks as if a
breath would blow him away; yet he encumbers
the earth year after year, holding one in a detestable
slavery to his whims and caprices. I shall be
an old man myself, or almost one, before Chestnutwood
falls into my possession; but when it
does"&mdash;and his eye flashed with hopeful anticipation,
and he walked with a prouder gait&mdash;"when
it does I will live!"</p>

<p>One day Hugo was just getting ready for a solitary
walk when the servant announced, "A gentleman
to see you, sir."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span></p>

<p>"A gentleman? What name?" asked Hugo.</p>

<p>"He said his name was Fitzgerald, sir."</p>

<p>"Fitzgerald?" exclaimed Hugo, his voice betraying
the excitement he felt. "Tell him I will
be with him at once."</p>

<p>He entered the drawing-room, and Fitzgerald
arose from a sofa on which he had seated himself.</p>

<p>"Ah! Fitzgerald!" said Hugo, with assumed
indifference.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is I. I have&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush! I am about to take a walk about
the place. You can join me, and whatever you
have to say, you can say more freely as we walk."</p>

<p>"Very well, sir; it is immaterial to me."</p>

<p>Hugo took his hat, and the two sauntered along
the broad walk till they reached a point at some
distance from the mansion.</p>

<p>"Mr. Fitzgerald, what have you got to tell me?"
asked Hugo eagerly.</p>

<p>"The boy won't trouble you any more," answered
Fitzgerald, sententiously.</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;the circus rider?"</p>

<p>"Certainly; your young cousin."</p>

<p>"Hush!" said Hugo, angerly. "How dare you
call him my cousin?"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span></p>

<p>"Because he was your cousin," said the other
firmly. "He stood between you and the property,
and that is why you wanted me to put him out of
the way."</p>

<p>"I won't discuss that matter just now&mdash;I will
simply ask you if you mean to assure me that the
boy is dead?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You can swear it?"</p>

<p>"Of course. He is at the bottom of a well in
a distant Western State, unless he has been fished
out."</p>

<p>"He must have been very careless to fall in,
whoever he was," said Hugo.</p>

<p>"Very much so!" said Fitzgerald mockingly.</p>

<p>"Well," said Hugo, philosophically, "he'd
probably have met with a violent death anyway.
This bareback riding is dangerous."</p>

<p>"So it is; I saw him thrown from his horse in
the ring at Crampton."</p>

<p>"Indeed! Was he hurt?"</p>

<p>"Sprained his ankle&mdash;that was all. He had to
retire from the ring for the season. Then I
offered him an engagement to travel with me
to the West."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span></p>

<p>"Indeed! Very kind of you!" said Hugo, indifferently.
"Well, shall we go back to the
house?"</p>

<p>"Go back to the house!" repeated Fitzgerald,
surprised. "Why, we haven't transacted our
business."</p>

<p>"Our business! Why, what business have I
with you?"</p>

<p>"I want pay for my work," answered Fitzgerald
sharply.</p>

<p>"Your work! Really, I don't remember to
have employed you," said Hugo with languid
indifference.</p>

<p>"Can he mean to go back on his promise?"
Fitzgerald asked himself uncomfortably.</p>

<p>"You promised me $2000 down when I had
done this job, and $3000 more when you came
into your inheritance," he said quickly.</p>

<p>Hugo, who was a man of consummate meanness,
could not bear to part with so large a sum of
money. Now that he had obtained all that he
desired, and believed that his young cousin, the
only possible obstacle between him and his uncle's
wealth, was out of the way, he thought he
might safely repudiate the bargain, and send<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
off Fitzgerald penniless, or at any rate with a
trifle.</p>

<p>"You seem to be dreaming, or romancing," he
said coldly.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say you did not promise me
the money?" he demanded passionately.</p>

<p>"I never did; of course not. I have never had
any dealings with you."</p>

<p>Fitzgerald clenched his hand together until the
nails entered the flesh. Had he committed a
detestable crime for nothing?</p>

<p>"Look here, Mr. Hugo Richmond," he said,
passionately. "This won't do! You are not
going to use me and then throw me off. Pay me
this money, or I will report you."</p>

<p>"You had better reflect before you try it," said
Hugo, composedly. "I shall accuse you of black-mail,
and your charge would never be believed."</p>

<p>"Wouldn't it? You may find yourself bitterly
mistaken."</p>

<p>"You must remember that in charging yourself
with murder you will run the risk of the
hangman's rope. Even if the charge could do me
any harm you would probably lose your own life."</p>

<p>This was no doubt true, and Fitzgerald stared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
at the man who had tempted him to a crime and
now threatened him with the consequences while
he held back the reward, with stupefaction.</p>

<p>"You see your plan won't work," said Hugo,
smoothly.</p>

<p>"I believe you are a fiend incarnate!" exclaimed
Fitzgerald, feeling baffled and defeated.</p>

<p>"Really, I don't much care what you think of
me."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to send me away penniless?"
asked Fitzgerald, hoarsely.</p>

<p>"No, I will take pity on your necessities and
give you fifty dollars. I don't recognize any
claims you may pretend to have on me, but I will
help you so far."</p>

<p>"Give me the fifty dollars, then!" said Fitzgerald,
sullenly.</p>

<p>Hugo drew from his wallet five ten-dollar bills,
and handed them to his companion.</p>

<p>"Now," said he, "I must wish you good morning.
Don't come in my way again!"</p>

<p>As Hugo walked back to the house Fitzgerald
looked after him.</p>

<p>"This will prove a bad morning's work for you,
Mr. Hugo Richmond!" he muttered.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII.<br />
<span class="small">FITZGERALD SEES AN APPARITION.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="caps">A <span class="upper">month</span> later North's circus had come as far
on its Eastern trip as Syracuse. Robert Rudd
was still with it, and again was employed in his
old business of riding. The young rider regularly
employed was sick, and feeling that his ankle had
become strong enough, Robert had volunteered to
take his place.</p>

<p>It so happened that Fitzgerald found himself
in Syracuse at this time. Fortune had smiled
upon him. He had carried the fifty dollars he
received from Hugo Richmond to the gaming-table,
and contrary to the usual fortune in such
cases had won steadily till he had a fund of ten
times the amount. Ordinarily he would have
kept on, but now he had a definite object in view,
and this was to revenge himself upon his faithless
employer.</p>

<p>"Why was I such a fool as to harm the boy?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
he had asked himself more than once. "The
cunning villain schemed to get me into his power,
and he has done so. I do not dare to expose him,
because in so doing I should risk my own life.
Why did I not send him out of the country
merely, and then claim the reward?"</p>

<p>But the past could not be recalled, and though
Fitzgerald heartily wished the boy alive, he always
thought of him as lying dead at the bottom
of a well in a far Western State. His busy brain
was trying to contrive some plan of revenge, when
he chanced to see a poster of North's circus.
Robert's name was not on the bill, as he was only
a substitute, not the regular rider.</p>

<p>The performance had commenced when Fitzgerald
entered.</p>

<p>He looked on with languid indifference till the
time came for Robert to enter the ring.</p>

<p>When Fitzgerald saw the boy, whom he supposed
to be dead, riding in the ring, he was as
much startled as if he had seen some one arise
from the dead. Could he be deceived? No.
There could be no such close resemblances between
two boys as between the rider and Robert
Rudd.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, it is he!" decided Fitzgerald, and his
heart was filled with gladness. As we know, the
gladness had a selfish source, but he was certainly
overjoyed to think that the boy was alive and well.</p>

<p>Robert went through his usual act with his
usual grace, and never suspected that his would-be
murderer was looking on.</p>

<p>When the performance was over, Fitzgerald
lingered near the tents till he saw Robert come
out. It was rather embarrassing to disclose himself
to the boy, who had so nearly fallen a victim
to his violence, but it must be done.</p>

<p>"Robert! Robert Rudd!" he said, touching
the boy on the arm.</p>

<p>Robert turned, and his face became stern when
he saw at his side the man who had tried to murder
him.</p>

<p>"You villain!" he said. "How have you the
face to show yourself to me?"</p>

<p>"Because," answered Fitzgerald, "I am prepared
to make atonement for the injury I did
you. No one can be more delighted to see you
than I."</p>

<p>"How can I trust you after what has passed?"
asked Robert, suspiciously.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't trust me till I show myself worthy of
trust. I am prepared to do more for you than
any man living."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Suppose that I tell you who you are, that I
restore you to your relatives, that I secure for you
the inheritance of a large estate, would you consider
that I am making atonement for my offence?"</p>

<p>"Can you do this?" asked Robert, eagerly.</p>

<p>"I can," answered Fitzgerald.</p>

<p>"What are your terms, for I suppose that you
do not work for nothing?"</p>

<p>"I stipulate nothing. When I have succeeded
and you come to your own I will trust to your
generosity. If that seems strange to you, I don't
mind telling you that I have a selfish motive. I
wish to revenge myself upon the man who occupies
your place, and whom you will disinherit."</p>

<p>"Will you give me fuller information?" asked
Robert. "Will you let me know who I am and
how I came to lose my home?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I am prepared to tell you all. Come to
the hotel where I am staying, and after you have
heard me we will concert together plans for reinstating
you."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV.<br />
<span class="small">THE MYSTERY OF ROBERT RUDD IS SOLVED.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="caps">H<span class="upper">ugo Richmond</span> was in good spirits. All
seemed working in his favor. He had got
rid of Robert, the rightful heir, and escaped paying
Fitzgerald the money he had agreed to pay
him. Now his uncle, whose feeble hold on life
had so long kept him from the coveted inheritance,
seemed getting weaker and weaker every
day. He was not positively sick, but he was sad
and despondent; his appetite had failed, and he
was more thin and shadowy than ever.</p>

<p>The wicked nephew could hardly conceal his
exultation as he looked on the feeble old man, and
calculated how few weeks he probably had to
live.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said to himself, "Chestnutwood
will soon be mine. And then&mdash;then I will take
care to be repaid for the slavery of the last eight
years."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span></p>

<p>Old Mr. Richmond could not read the nephew's
heart, nor did he suspect his baseness. He
thought him sincerely devoted to his interests.</p>

<p>"A gentleman to see you, sir," announced the
servant, interrupting one of Hugo's day dreams.</p>

<p>"Who is it?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, sir; but I think he has been
here before."</p>

<p>When Hugo entered the drawing-room and saw
Fitzgerald, he stopped short with a frown.</p>

<p>"You here?" he said.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am here," answered the other proudly.</p>

<p>"You might as well have stayed away. If you
think you can levy any black-mail you are mistaken."</p>

<p>"I expect nothing of the kind."</p>

<p>"Probably you don't want any money?" said
Hugo, sneering.</p>

<p>"Not from you," answered Fitzgerald, eying
him steadily.</p>

<p>"You don't want money?" exclaimed Hugo, in
genuine surprise.</p>

<p>"No, though I have no doubt you would be
very glad to give me a large sum."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span></p>

<p>"You are quite mistaken. I suspect you are
drunk."</p>

<p>"That is where you are mistaken."</p>

<p>"What is your object in coming, then? Is this
a friendly call?" asked Hugo, with an evident
sneer.</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps it may be so considered; I
came to give you a friendly warning."</p>

<p>"A warning?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I really can't conceive how I can need any
warning from you. What is your warning?"</p>

<p>"I warn you to leave the country as soon as it
is in your power."</p>

<p>Hugo laughed scornfully.</p>

<p>"Thank you for nothing," he said; "why
should I leave the country?"</p>

<p>"Because you will otherwise be charged with
instigating the murder of your cousin, known as
Robert Rudd."</p>

<p>"Humph! No one will credit it. Besides,
you will have to admit that you killed him."</p>

<p>"You are mistaken again. He is not dead."</p>

<p>"Not dead?" echoed Hugo, turning pale and
sinking into a seat.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span></p>

<p>"No, he is as much alive as you or I, but I am
prepared to swear that you hired me to kill him."</p>

<p>"Villain! you deceived me!" exclaimed Hugo,
furiously.</p>

<p>"I feel less a villain than if I had compassed
the boy's death."</p>

<p>Hugo reflected a moment. A gulf seemed
to open before him, and just as his uncle was
nearing death all his schemes seemed in danger
of failure. This must be prevented at all hazards.</p>

<p>"Fitzgerald!" he said, in an altered tone, "this
thing can yet be arranged. You have gained an
advantage over me, I grant, and I am prepared to
make it worth your while to keep this thing
hushed up. What are your terms?"</p>

<p>"Why should I name terms when you have
once treacherously gone back on your word?"</p>

<p>"I will not do so again."</p>

<p>"Do you want me to kill the boy?"</p>

<p>"No! Let him live, but never let him suspect
who he is."</p>

<p>"And for this you will give me&mdash;how much?"</p>

<p>"Five thousand dollars!" answered Hugo, after
a brief pause.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span></p>

<p>"It is a good sum, but your uncle's property
amounts to a quarter of a million, at least."</p>

<p>"Nothing like it," answered Hugo, hurriedly.
"Besides, he is likely to leave a large part to charitable
institutions."</p>

<p>"Not if you can prevent it," thought Fitzgerald.</p>

<p>"It is useless!" he said aloud. "I am not to
be bought."</p>

<p>"What, then, do you require?" asked Hugo,
desperately.</p>

<p>"I require you to leave the country, and acknowledge
Robert Rudd as your cousin."</p>

<p>"Never!" said Hugo, fiercely.</p>

<p>"Very well!" said Fitzgerald, rising.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?" asked Hugo,
anxiously.</p>

<p>"To leave you to your fate! Within a few
hours you will be arrested on a charge of complicity
in an attempted murder."</p>

<p>"Stay!" exclaimed Hugo, now thoroughly
alarmed. "How far has this gone? Surely you
have not revealed anything to Robert Rudd?</p>

<p>"Everything," answered Fitzgerald, laconically.</p>

<p>"To any one else?"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, to a lawyer, who is possessed of all the
evidence in the case, and is prepared to communicate
all to your uncle!"</p>

<p>"Is this true?" asked Hugo, pale with dismay.</p>

<p>"You can believe it or not. I have only this
to say, that you had better go with me to the
hotel where your cousin and his lawyer are now
staying, and assure yourself whether we are in
earnest."</p>

<p>"Suppose I grant your demands and acknowledge
the boy?"</p>

<p>"Then you will be suffered to go where you
please unharmed."</p>

<p>"I will go with you."</p>

<p>Hugo accompanied Fitzgerald to the hotel, had
a private interview with the lawyer, and decided
that opposition was useless. He took care, however,
to feather his own nest by appropriating a
large amount of government bonds belonging to
his uncle, which, in addition to his pickings and
stealings for eight years past, provided him with
a competency. The theft could not be proved,
for he alone had the charge of his uncle's affairs.
With his ill-gotten gains he sailed for Europe,
where he is now residing.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span></p>

<p>The joy of Cornelius Richmond when his
grandson was restored to him can be imagined.
It seemed to bring him back from the grave and
restore his strength. A tutor was at once engaged
to remedy Robert Rudd's&mdash;now Robert
Richmond's&mdash;defective education, and money
was actually lavished upon him by his doting
grandfather. But Robert stood the test of prosperity
as he had stood the test of adversity. He
remained the same frank, manly, self-respecting
boy, and was not drawn into squandering his
money in policy or dissipation. But he delighted
to help those of his former associates who were
unfortunate and needed assistance&mdash;for instance,
a trapeze performer, who having fractured a leg
by a fall from the trapeze, was left in want with
a wife and four young children dependent upon
his exertions. For months Robert allowed him
$10 a week, and was heartily glad that his
grandfather's liberality allowed him also to be
liberal.</p>

<p>Our hero rejoiced the heart of his old friend
Anak by the gift of a handsome gold watch, and
he also remembered others who had been kind to
him. He has sent an invitation to Sidney Grey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
to visit him at Chestnutwood, and has requested
Squire Grey to transfer the $200 entrusted to him
to his son. He had intended to offer a home to
Charlie Davis, his associate rider, but Charlie had
already attracted the attention of a gentleman,
who had offered to adopt him at the close of the
present season. My readers may be interested to
know that Master Charlie is this very summer
travelling with a circus through the New England
States and Canada. Having lamed his foot, he,
too, is engaged for the time being in selling prize
packages and candy, but will probably retire from
professional life in October. Hundreds of the
boys who read this story will probably see him at
some time during the season.</p>

<p>Robert is busily employed in remedying the
deficiencies in his education, and is already entrusted
with a large part of the business connected
with the management of his grandfather's property.
From the latter has been concealed Hugo's
wicked attempt to make away with Robert, as it
would shock the old man and affect him injuriously.
But he seldom inquires for his nephew,
to whom he was never much attached. He is
quite content with the company of his grandson.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
There are few who know that Robert Richmond,
the heir of Chestnut wood, was once</p>

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
